For context, one time while talking to my mom, I told her that suicide has always been “on the shelf” in my brain. And more frequently than I care to admit, I stare at it. Contemplating taking it doing again. She asked me how we can go about removing it from the “shelf”, in other words, making it not an option. I was quiet for a bit and told her it will always be on the shelf. The best I feel I can hope for is that it becomes dusty and forgotten. 

My first attempt was at 14, unknown to anyone. My second was at 16 and I was in the hospital for a week. I describe the feeling as ... nothingness or a hole or pit that you fall into sometimes, more than you’d like,  and it’s suffocating and you can’t get out. And for as long as I can remember it’s always been there. And I don’t know why. I have all the mechanisms and factors in my life that “should” result in happiness and healthiness.

I been struggling with disappointment after disappointment since my high school days (I’m 30 now) and clinging on to this word “hope” has made things drawn out for me. 

They say be patient and and rely on hope but man I can’t do it anymore. I’m fed up of relationships/flings that are just bandages, hanging with friends cool but as soon as I get home the pain comes back. 

My ex tells me she wishes things ended differently but doesn’t want to work it out. I try to get it to work. But I can tell from her responses and lack Therof she’s telling me “lol get over it man” 

Seeing other women don’t help either if anything it makes the pain worst. Regrets of past decisions. My last breakup. And just trying to tell myself things will get better for more than a decade is getting exhausting. I’m seriously over life

264268,"stalemateIm 25(m), soon turning 26 and I have nothing to show for myself. I have lost all of my friends last year because I have told them about my depression and suicidal ideation 5 years ago and nothing has changed till last year, then they finally cut me off. I understand them. I am constantly negative and I havent been moving forward for years, while everybody else has. I am inferior in all regards to anyone I used to be friends with. 
For a year now I have socially isolated myself from the outside, and I spent the whole sitting in front of my computer 95% of the time. The only times i went out are to get some food. 
I have no job and no prospects for the future. I  aimlessly attended university for 3 years switching between majors, and nothing came out of it. It is too late to start an apprenticeship in a field I like, everything is just too competitive for an inferior human like me. I am constantly asking myself that even if I were to apply for apprenticeships, why anyone would want to hire somebody like me who has struggled with mental illness since I was 12 years old, if there is a 17-20 year old happy human applying for the same job as I am. of course they don't know about my mental state if I don't tell them but I have no way of lying about my last 5 aimless years and no way of making them sound rather positive than negative. my cv is worthless because of too many gaps due to mental illness. I don't want to work as a cleaning person and I don't want to work on an assembly line. 
I feel like my only option to succeed in the working world from now on would be to start some kind of business and be self employed since my chances are too slim to get anywhere in the corporate world. But I don't know what and I certainly don't have the thick skin for this kind of adventure..
I have thought about getting more help but it's the same all the time. The answer to anything is always within oneself and only I can change myself for the better. I could start to take ssris again, talk to some therapist and listen to the same things over and over again. it just doesn't help me. 
I could submit myself to a psychiatric ward, but all that would do is for the doctors there to give me benzodiazepines and make sure I am not going to kill myself. 
I have fucked up everything because of my depression, inferiority complex, and never being strong enough to pull through. I now am here in top of my selffulfilling prophecy. everything is dull. I've tried to kms twice, one time cutting (I stopped because it hurt too much, now I have 2 ugly scars on my forearm) and one time by taking 20 5mg lorazepam pills which unfortunately just sent me into a 23 hour sleep coma. 
I have been researching everything I can about suicide methods and now know how I will end my life. Decapitation by train seems to be the best option for me although I'd prefer a shotgun, but since guns are illegal to own where I live (Germany) that is just not a possibility. 

I know for certain that I will never be able to ditch my inferiority complex. Over the last 2 years my soul and my heart have become bitter to the core. I have become addicted to smoking weed and cigarettes. So a cleanse would also take some time, which I just don't have anymore.

Being an almost 26 year old male with mental illnesses, not enough skills to compete in the workplace, and being only 5'4 (165cm) will not help me to go anywhere. it only helps to strengthen my beliefs of being unnecessary and disposable. Now that I have no friends left there is also no point in trying anymore. 
I will run out of money to support myself at the end of February, which will also be the day of my birthday, 02/28.

272277,"A bittersweet 20th birthday today I turn 20 today (26/02) and I’m not sure how to feel. I went through some of the toughest things as a teen and also the best days (so far) of my life. 
I’m not sure why I am making this post but mainly it is to say that it is possible to reach 20, for the longest time I didn’t think I would see 14 or 16 or 18 let alone 20. I did not think I would make these milestones, being diagnosed depressed at 12 and feeling suicidal for the most part of my teen years I never thought I would outlive being a teen and yet here I am. 
For the most part I am happy. 
I have made it this far and I have learnt a lot, I have lost people so dear to me and I have gained a few people I will never forget. 

I’m going to tell my story and explain why it is important to keep going even if it feels impossible. 
At home I had a rocky life with my stepdad being in and out and loosing all connection with my real dad which was a mind boggling struggle I have now accepted. 
My school life was no easier, at 13 I was sat down and was told I wasn’t welcome in my friend group. I was devastated but realise this has taught me not everyone has your best interest at heart. 
At 14 I came out as bisexual and was scared to admit and face it to my peers.
At 15 I lost my girl friends because I couldn’t cope with the negativity they brought and chose to leave, this taught me it’s okay to loose people for your best interest and to be selfish.

At 16 I made the best friends I have had. I had the most wild year of living, the childhood I missed out; playing in the woods, trying new things, having sleepovers and walking for miles, it really was my best year. Then suddenly I lost one of them (to suicide) and really mourned that, understanding that it would easily have been me and seeing the repercussions and realising the effect it had. 
From 16-18 I was in a relationship which I cannot sum up into words but thought would be never ending as I loved hard and gave my absolute everything. To realise it wasn’t meant to be and was harmful. I never thought I would overcome that but now am in a stable relationship.

I went through moving schools and collages, gaining friends and loosing them to experiencing some of the worst traumas (sexual assault) a person aged 60 hasn’t gone through. I have lived wildly and beautifully, sometimes tragically and painfully for 20 years. 

I want every teenager to know that it will get better. There will be a time that you leave home and escape abuse or poverty, you will grow and succeed and sometimes fail and that is okay. 
You will find friends or loose friends (I have no friends) and it’s okay, it’s better to have no company than bad company. 
You will flourish and fail and that’s normal, no one has any idea what they are doing so keep going with no plan, a good plan, or a failure of a plan.

My life is not good but it’s better than it was. It’s a few hours since I turned 20 and I still know nothing but I promise 14 year old you will survive this and you will learn and grow and loose and fight and it will be okay. 
I am terrified of my 20’s but I am grateful to have had my teen years. 

Please reach out if you need help, to me or a teacher or anyone.

4 years ago i was on top of my game, i had an athletic build, i was socially great even had girlfriend(s). Then i had a drinking problem which led to a major depressive disorder. From than, my life keeps getting screwed for 4 years. This makes roughly 1460 days, 121 months,  35.040 hours. Can you imagine living a doomed life for that long. The only reason i have been alive so far was the hope of change and a strong temptation to resist the natural selection. Through those years, my view about life completely changed for many times. I had close friends trying to ""change my perspective"" by uttering some ideas which sounded like they are taken from a spiritualist-self improvement-bullshit-but-i-still-had-your-money  type of books. Now i am in a situation in which i am broke, physically fucked up, semi-social pushover (some people still have respect for me because of my previous works and the intellectual capital which i possess) and i have god-knows-what disorder which taxes me mentally. I almost tried to change everything i have control over in order to make some difference but my attemps have failed very badly. Last 2 days i started to have episodes of anger and extreme sadness. During those i have decided to end all of this. Now some people might think that me writing this is a sign of seeking help/support because of subconcious thought but no seriously i have no fucking idea why am i sharing this to an internet platform. Another thing i want to say to the  people reading this subreddit is i was thinking like you once while reading all suicide notes and even trying to help them, i was thinking that some of the posts are really stupid or not a reason to kill yourself. But believe me my friends, this is a position where you wish to project your feelings emphateticly but words are inadequete for this purpose.

This was an absolute nightmare, mainly because I started having flashbacks of a similar incident in a hotel, which was a traumatic experience for me and my dad.

The time was 11:30 pm and my parents were asleep. First step - don't make noise. This would attract them. Second- try to solve this. First, I flushed again.. didn't work, obviously. Now we don't have a plunger or whatever, so I thought what I could do.

Then I googled some solutions. All of them required baking soda or shit, which I didn't have (and I didn't have the time for it either)

Then I thought if water hit the shit at a high velocity it would force the shit down the pipe

Filled a bucket (it did make some noise though) and dumped it in the sink

Nothing happened, the bowl flooded and eventually the water receded

I filled another bucket and while I was waiting looked into the mirror and gave myself a 'pep talk' of sorts

Once the bucket filled I lifted the bucket HIGH up, and dumped in the bowl

The shit dissapeared, and I felt RELEIF. Fuck, I am so happy! I UNIRONICALLY feel like a fucking god for having done this on my own.

Also, my dad used the bathroom JUST NOW for taking a piss, and he didn't notice anything.

246144,"The end of quarantine is gonna be kinda symbolic in my town (plus more advice and shit) So my town has essentially confirmed (can’t say for sure because it’s 2020 and everything always gets worse this year) that school begins in a hybrid format on September 10, and that depending on which group you’re in, you go back either September 10 or 11.

I view that as kinda symbolic because the time when the last major tragedy happened in 9/11 (the recession maybe but I’m going with 9/11 here) is when we’re likely finally gonna be able to put quarantine behind us, hopefully for good. 19 years ago it was a very tragic day, but this year it will hopefully be a very triumphant day.

It’s also kinda weird knowing how we started this whole thing, not knowing how deep in shit we were back on the night of March 11 and it will likely take all of six months and finally end on or around September 11. It‘s weird how that works out because they were on opposite ends of the calendar year, and were very different tragedies.

Maybe I’m not making sense, hope I make sense to some people lol.

I’m just so excited for my senior year and to hopefully see some of my friends again. I’ve been going through in my head all of my friends by last name as I think that’s how they’ll do it by when it comes to groups.

I just hope that this hybrid shit doesn’t last the whole year, but you can’t be greedy in 2020, if you’re greedy you get rewarded with remote learning or another major world disaster. Back in June and early July I was very confident in being back fully in person and what happened? Trump opened up his damn mouth, they switched it to hybrid and the extreme negative momentum made it feel like remote learning was inevitable, the second I accepted that this year was cursed and that we can’t have good things they essentially confirmed hybrid.

For everyone who is returning to school this year and not fully on Zoom, SOAK IT ALL IN! Soak in every bit of it, enjoy every moment because you have no idea how long it will last. I live in a very liberal state and I have no doubt that if coronavirus gets even remotely bad again they’ll pull the plug faster than you can say “social distancing”.

Enjoy every moment, every memory, document it, keep a journal, because 2020 will try to rip it away from you. This isn’t gonna get that much better until at least this awful election cycle is over and maybe not until the New Year. I know numbers are dropping but still, that probably means that we’ll probably have another national tragedy in September (as this year we tend to have a different national tragedy every three months), because the last time coronavirus dropped massive protests and riots happened that made it spike again.

Another piece of advice, don’t make fun of lockdowns and shit because it’ll make them happen again. On March 10 or even March 11, the last day, I vividly remember mocking the word “quarantine” as my mom dropped me off at school. A week later, I wasn’t laughing. The night of March 11 ONE HOUR before we got the call that school was cancelled for the week, I remember telling my friends at my last normal extracurricular for the year “Guys, it’s just the flu, don’t worry.” Just four nights later, when school was cancelled into April and all major sports were cancelled or postponed, I wasn’t laughing.

To my fellow class of 2021 members and the class of 2020, we’re in this together, we’re the coronavirus classes and will always be joined at the hip because of that.

To the class of 2020, watching you lose it all hurt me, not getting a chance to say goodbye to you on your last day (and then making the rest of May and June a party as the new seniors, my dad says that that was the best part of his junior year) really sucked. Maybe I didn’t like some of you all that much even like 9 months ago, but as I made more friends from your class as 2019 became 2020 I grew to really like you guys. Be proud that you graduated and hold your heads high as you look to college or any other plan you have for the future.

To my fellow class of 2021 members, we’re almost there, and let’s all pray for an amazing 2021 to make up for this god-awful 2020, pray for a vaccine, pray for a healthy family and friends. It’s probably gonna be a rough year, at least to start. We might not get all the events we dreamed of, or get them at a later date, and it’s okay to be sad about that, it’s okay to cry, just remember that we’re all in this together until the very end. If we get a vaccine we could have an amazing spring, a storybook finish, and even without one we still have a chance for most of our events.

Peace out and stay safe everyone.",non-suicide,"The end of quarantine is gonna be kinda symbolic in my town (plus more advice and shit) So my town has essentially confirmed (can't say for sure because it's 2020 and everything always gets worse this year) that school begins in a hybrid format on September 10, and that depending on which group you're in, you go back either September 10 or 11.

survive to see the confetti fall from the sky, those who
did not live to watch the parade roll down the street.
I have grown accustomed to a lifetime of aphorisms
meant to assuage my fears, pithy sayings meant to

167797,"My Story, A Hopeful Story (It is long just so you know)First off I would like to say that most people on this sub reddit are going through so much more than I ever did. I would just like to shed some light on how I had an awful mindset on life but I found a way to turn it around and right now I feel I am on the way to recovery.

I guess I should give you my background with depression. I have always been a very skinny and weak boy. I am currently 17 6 foot and 121 pounds to put it in perspective. I was bullied throughout middle school because of it and I feel officially became depressed in 8th grade when I first said something to my parents. They did the usual thing to do and they ignored it as did I with my own depression, I buried it deep and hoped it never came out.

It did. Last Summer shortly after turning 17 I had my first girlfriend ever. We were instantly best friends and did everything together. We quickly fell in love and everything was good. But there was a dark side to her. She would yell at me when she was sad and when she was mad she would make personal attacks. We fought often but never in person when we were together everything was okay. She also was consumed by her own depression, cutting, bulemia, and suicidal thoughts. She had been through a lot, her sadness was fully justified but it was a lot to deal with. I stayed up many hours for her, my grades dropped because of it and homework became one less of a priority. Her depression started to bring out my depression. I became more cynical about life but continued to stay in love with my girlfriend. I was always there for her but I suppose I was never there for me. 

We continued on like this for a few months but like all teen couples, something went horribly wrong. I am a sexually active pro life male. My girlfriend was a sexually active female. One night the condom malfunctioned we will say and one month later we learned that we were parents. At first we were scared but then we saw it as a new chapter in our lives where we may get ourselves out of our depression's. When my girlfriend was three months pregnant however, she had a miscarriage. All my friends say its no big deal our baby was never alive, but she was at three months she had a heartbeat and we had known about her for two months (I say her because we both had a hunch it was a girl, never confirmed). When my girlfriend had her miscarriage it devasted her, it destroyed her. I think in the week that followed everything went to hell. The day after she lost our child she cheated on me because she did not know what to do (I learned 3 months after I will explain later) she attempted suicide around 3 times a day, and cut herself all over and even stabbed herself in the intestines. I did not sleep all I could do was worry and cry every second of the day. One day in school she wrote me a note saying she was going to kill herself. I wrote her a note every period urging her to see the brighter side of life when even i couldn't see it. Every minute felt like a hour, class was unbearable that day. Fortunately she survived not for lack of trying and our relationship went on. 

Three months went by and with that I had two therapists and everyone worried about me. Then my girlfriend's uncle killed himself. Her uncle's death made her so cold. I became her punching bag and I knew it. But I loved her so much I did not care. Once again I was taking care of her but not myself. Then 6 days after I was asking her if she had smoked pot again because I hated her when she was high and she said yes. I asked her what else she was hiding and she told me she cheated on me the day after our daughter passed with my best friend. I was so angry I threw my phone against the wall and shattered half of it. I am NOT a violent person. I had had my suspicions about the two of them for a long time and I feel like I had always known but to be flat out told destroyed me. I was very mature about I tried to forgive her and told her to forgive herself. That was part of the reasoning behind her trying to kill herself. She could not live with what she did. After that day nothing was the same. Her parent's soon found out we were having sex and I was banned from seeing her, blocked on Facebook, blocked on Twitter, and my phone number was blocked. I had sacrificed all my friends to make our relationship work. Now I was alone. 

Nothing in our relationship really worked after that. We both still loved each other but we knew it could not work. My parents hated her and her parents hated me. We were holding on to a dying connection and I felt so alone. I will never forget the first day I cut. I had given my girlfriend my password so we could message my own account on facebook so we could actually communicate like human beings. But we were fighting. I felt like I had nowhere else to turn, I took a steak knife and slit my thighs. 

Our relationship soon ended. I will never forget this night either. We never had time with each other so staying together was impossible. There were too many fights too many scars too much anger at each other. We broke up and 15 minutes later she started dating her guy best friend. The one she had promised she wouldn't ever date because she had sex with her last guy best friend. My best friend, while we were dating. 

I felt so betrayed. I wanted to kill myself I could not handle it, the pain was intolerable. To know that I was all alone in the world now while she was holding his hand and smiling, destroyed my very soul. I cut all over and punched my self in the jaw until I almost broke it. People asked me where the bruises were from afterward and I simply shrugged it off. I proceeded to try and get her back. In some ways I did. She cheated on her boyfriend with me and it was obvious part of her still wanted me. The thing was is that we would just never work and I failed to see that. 

I was fighting an uphill battle and that destroyed my mental state. Every night I got on skype with my ex and just seeing her face and seeing how it would take her so long to answer my messages because she was with her boyfriend destroyed me, but I was addicted to it. I started to think about suicide. She started to actually look at me when I started to take pills. So it encouraged me. One day I actually was going to go through with it. I fortunately did not take enough pills and I simply was tripping talking to my ex girlfriend waiting for myself to pass out and die. She was waiting for the same thing. She called my friends and they all rushed over to my house and broke in and told my parents what was happening. Watching my mother cry like that really put everything in perspective. After that I did not try it again. 

I continued to cut but slowly I got better, then I went on the most amazing vacation of my life. It wasn't the location or the girls or the anything I saw. It was the way I reflected on my life and realized that I had amazing friends whos friendships I could easily repair. I came back a new man. I started listening to more upbeat music and lifted my GPA 15 points. I went out with my friends again and started living the HighSchool Senior lifestyle I knew I could have. I flirted with other girls and finally got over my ex. I am actually going to my senior ball (I have never been one for dances, mostly because I am insecure). I think all in all it was just the outlook I had in life that determined everything. I could finally hold a smile and not be lying. I did exciting things and finally stopped cutting. I am currently 3 weeks sober from cutting. I hope that everyone who is struggling with thoughts of suicide just knows that there is a brighter side of life. For most of you there are tons of people that care about and love you. For some there are tons of people who's lives you will make a difference in. There are stories of fun and lightheartedness to be shared. Putting a smile on and focusing on the positive can do a lot. Do not get me wrong I trip up a lot, usually sundays I get really depressed but you can fight on and rely on other things to get your mind off things. Whether it is video games, friends, or reading a good book, or even exercise. It helped with me, and I hope it helps you.

301413,"So far, I have missed 3/9 of my periodic exams out of my own accord. I just don't feel motivated, really. The only reason I got to finish other exams is either because they're easy or unconditional support from a teacher. These ones I missed, they're too much for me to handle. They amount to around 10-20% of my grade in each subject.

Can't blame them though, there's so much awful shit we see every day it's numbing us.

It's almost as if people still have a very idealized perspective on mental illness and just go off the ""don't worry, everything will be ok! Let me coddle you so you stay in your escapist bubble"" because they don't realize that isn't healthy.

The way mental health culture is, particularly online, just pisses me off in ways I'm not sure how to articulate. It's like people just want to keep you in this state so that you can keep being the way you are with no improvement.

I wouldn't doubt if the pharmaceutical industry added to the sickeningly infantile ""please keep taking your meds, and breath! You're a worthless sack of shit worth nothing to society, but that's ok, you're human &lt;3"" attitude that people have when talking about mental health.

174612,"How should I die?It has been a week (?) trying to keep up the convo with the life coaching line provided by our company. They seem to respond poorly. I never get to the point why I wanna die already. So, I’ll just post here and rant about my life. This will become my suicide note — the one that’s hard to find. No one knows I’m on reddit. Or if anyone knows, they don’t know how to use the app and/or they don’t know that I post here. Because I vent out on Twitter all the time.

Let’s start with my family, on how I became the biggest disappointment amongst my sibs...

Eldest is a CPA, she never failed any subject, quiz, exam, etc. in school. She is very bright and humorous. My parents loves her. Bought her a laptop when she graduated from college. Which is a big thing because we are not rich. Second is now a CpE. My parents bought him almost all kinds of instruments (e.g. electric guitar, acoustic guitar, drum set, bass guitar, violin, keyboard, and many more) and supports him on his every gig (my mom is always there on the front seats when they perform) since he is very good in music. He is now working in Japan. They both are graduate from a high-end University.

And I am the youngest. I never graduated from college. I took 2 years and finished pre-Dentistry at a so-so school, but never got to Dentistry proper. Why? I got pregnant at 18. My parents threw me out of the house while I was pregnant. I lived with my then boyfriend (that is also undergraduate and doesn’t have a job) at a squatters area. Neighbors are drug addicts, a person dies every other day because of illegal drugs, police are around the area every nights, some houses are caught on fire (which, everyone though it a movement of some vigilantes because those houses are ‘spots’ where people do drugs). I gave birth and still lived there for another 3 months.

I went home to my parents since I don’t want my daughter to grow up in that kind of environment. My parents finally accepted my daughter. I found a new boyfriend who has a stable job, he is my boss on my new job. I lived with him for (6 or 7) months, while my daughter lives with my parents. He abuses me physically, emotionally, and sexually. (I don’t wanna talk about it in details.) So, we broke up, left my job, and I lived with my parents for a couple of months. And, after I found my new job, I also found my new boyfriend. The one I have now. I love him so much. We’re running at almost two years now.

We already have my daughter together with us for a year now. Here’s the story of why:

My now boyfriend and I went over to my parents’ since they want us to took after my daughter because all of ‘em have something to do that day. There’s no problem. We even went out on a family date (just the three of us). And when we got home, my father is already there drinking himself to death. And talked to my boyfriend. When he is drunk, he makes these unrealistic scenarios. And because of that, he thought my boyfriend isn’t serious about our relationship. My dad pulled his gun out to frighten my boyfriend. We went away from there and after a few weeks, we took my daughter with us. We are now a family, finally.

My kid is turning three, and I don’t feel like I am being a good (enough) mother for her. There are times that she doesn’t have milk anymore, or diapers. She’s not even going to school yet. I feel like I can’t provide her the basic needs she should have. And my boyfriend doesn’t seem to understand me when I vent out to him. He doesn’t listen very good. But I love him. And I love how my kid loves him too. I don’t thing I’m giving them, both, enough to keep me as their mother and partner.

My shitty life and low-paying job is not enough to live anymore. For some, this may be too shallow. But, fuck, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for this long post, too.

I just don’t want to live anymore since I don’t feel like I’m doing enough. It never leaves my mind on how worthless I am. I just wanna kill myself already and end this miserable thoughts and what-ifs...

My parents bought him almost all kinds of instruments (e.g. electric guitar, acoustic guitar, drum set, bass guitar, violin, keyboard, and many more) and supports him on his every gig (my mom is always there on the front seats when they perform) since he is very good in music. He is now working in Japan. They both are graduate from a high-end University. And I am the youngest. I never graduated from college. I took 2 years and finished pre-Dentistry at a so-so school, but never got to Dentistry proper. Why? I got pregnant at 18. My parents threw me out of the house while I was pregnant. I lived with my then boyfriend (that is also undergraduate and doesn't have a job) at a squatters area. Neighbors are drug addicts, a person dies every other day because of illegal drugs, police are around the area every nights, some houses are caught on fire (which, everyone though it a movement of some vigilantes because those houses are 'spots' where people do drugs). I gave birth and still lived there for another 3 months. I went home to my parents since I don't want my daughter to grow up in that kind of environment. My parents finally accepted my daughter. I found a new boyfriend who has a stable job, he is my boss on my new job. I lived with him for (6 or 7) months, while my daughter lives with my parents. He abuses me physically, emotionally, and sexually. (I don't wanna talk about it in details.) So, we broke up, left my job, and I lived with my parents for a couple of months. And, after I found my new job, I also found my new boyfriend. The one I have now. I love him so much. We're running at almost two years now. We already have my daughter together with us for a year now. Here's the story of why: My now boyfriend and I went over to my parents' since they want us to took after my daughter because all of 'em have something to do that day. There's no problem. We even went out on a family date (just the three of us). And when we got home, my father is already there drinking himself to death. And talked to my boyfriend. When he is drunk, he makes these unrealistic scenarios. And because of that, he thought my boyfriend isn't serious about our relationship. My dad pulled his gun out to frighten my boyfriend. We went away from there and after a few weeks, we took my daughter with us. We are now a family, finally. My kid is turning three, and I don't feel like I am being a good (enough) mother for her. There are times that she doesn't have milk anymore, or diapers. She's not even going to school yet. I feel like I can't provide her the basic needs she should have. And my boyfriend doesn't seem to understand me when I vent out to him. He doesn't listen very good. But I love him. And I love how my kid loves him too. I don't thing I'm giving them, both, enough to keep me as their mother and partner. My shitty life and low-paying job is not enough to live anymore. For some, this may be too shallow. But, fuck, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for this long post, too. I just don't want to live anymore since I don't feel like I'm doing enough. It never leaves my mind on how worthless I am. I just wanna kill myself already and end this miserable thoughts and what-ifs... How do you think should I die?",suicide,0.5779378,0.77373266,0.4619423,0.3640219,0.34232095

200071,"why even try if we are all going to dieI never understood why people would work so hard in life. Life is a waste of time that I am not willing to hold onto. We are all going to die, rather you like it or not. I don’t care about anything anymore, I just want to die and get this hell over with. If reincarnation is real, so be it, I’ll kill myself again, and again. If hell is real, so be it, the real hell is being alive.

Growing up, life has been no crystal stair. My dad was physically abusive with me and my mom wouldn’t do shit about it. Now I’m a teen, and he expects us to have a happy and healthy father-son relationship. Because fuck the past right?

I have been doing okay in school until now. I’m a complete failure. My parents were never content with all of my B’s and high C’s, so I just gave up completely. I never felt a sense of accomplishment with them. I never felt like I have genuinely made my parents proud. Sure they will tell me I make them proud everyday, but the world knows it doesn’t come from the bottom of their hearts.

I have nothing hire than a C right now and I have lots of D’s and F’s. I have had times where I would try to improve, but to no avail. I am intoxicated with procrastination and deprivation of wanting to live any longer. We are born so the government can suck money out of us, and our parents. They are getting their penny’s worth. They want us to be in incredible debt and to beg for loans, only to be in more debt. They want schools to encourage college so we can burn hundreds of thousands of dollars just to re-live high school all over again and get a degree for something you were never truly interested in. 

All of the successful people are smacked on to your face to leave a real good red mark on it so you can feel like shit every god damn time you reflect on yourself.

You can’t get any better, in anything, because you are just too damn tired of life’s bullshit. Life isn’t worth it. It really isn’t. Sure, go ahead and start a multi-billion dollar company and buy yourself 3 mansions and 12 studios and 2 lamborghinis just for the hell of it. But just know that you are going to lose it all when you die. 

I’m a social introvert, and I embrace it. I hate talking to people, I hate people that talk to me, I hate everyone. I hate society. I hate mainstream media and news. I hate everything. I hate the world. I hate myself. I hate my life. Everything is terrible. God has sent me down to this hell so he can amuse himself just by watching me suffer and expects me to get on my knees and bend over for him as I pray for his mercy. Fuck that. Just let me die already, what’s the hold up? IM RIGHT HERE GOD, LOOK AT ME NOW. YOU CREATED ME IN YOUR OWN IMAGE RIGHT??? IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED? NO??? THEN FUCK YOU!! I should just kill myself right now, even writing this is a waste of time, god nows I’m a depressed sociopath.

My dad has tried to open me up several times. I fucking hate it when people try getting into my head. FUCK OFF! YOU WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND. EVEN AFTER I HALF-ASSEDLY OPENED UP TO HIM AND CLEARLY STATED I FELT DEPRESSED HE JUST CORRELATED IT ALL WITH THE FACT THAT I NEED MORE FRIENDS. **FUCK THAT DAD. AND FUUCK FRIENDS** YOU CAN NEVER TRUST PEOPLE, FUCK PEOPLE. THE WORLD IS FILLED WITH BACKSTABBING RATS.

I hate it when my family brings up the girlfriend bullshit. LOOK ME STRAIGHT IN THE GOD DAMN EYES AND SAY I HAVE A CHANCE WITH A WOMAN. FUCKING DO IT! EVEN IF I WERE TO EVER HAVE THE LOOKS, THEY WOULD NEVER DATE A PIECE OF SHIT FILTH LIKE ME. EVERYONE SAYS I HAVE THE LOOKS. MAYBE I DO. BUT MY FUCKED UP TEETH DONT HAVE ANYTHING GOIMG FOR ME.

FUCK THIS SHIT. AND FUCK THOSE GOD DAMN BACKSTABBING SONS OF BITCHES THIEVES THAT ARE DENTISTS. IF I FUCKING KILL MYSELF TODAY I SURE AS FUCK HOPE I CAN MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL TO BE A FUCKING DEMON AND KILL YOUR ENTIRE FUCKING FAMILY WHILE YOU CRY TO YOUR SHITTY GOD FOR MERCY.

Life is a waste of time, and there is nothing going for me.

You may be one of these people but don't worry, you can help fix the problem. 

When someone states their opinion or criticizes someone, do not get triggered. Do not try to change their opinion. 

If you disagree with them, either ignore them, or try to put yourself in their shoes. If you do this and you still cannot see why their opinion is as it is, that's fine. Just accept everyone is different and move on. 



Btw this was a guide for those people, in perspective you were already triggered. If you aren't incredibly sensitive, keep doing what your doing.

People are too sensitive these days so just be cautious before you respond to someone. Everyone is different and has different opinions so don't try to change that

306615,"I'm turning 20 in about an hour, time to share a pinch of stuff I've learned this past decade To preface, I'm gonna try my best to keep this short and quick, I don't want to bore you guys with a lengthy essay. Instead, I've devised a list of rules that I try my best to follow. These are written in hopes that they'll guide you through daily life as a growing, and perhaps, confused teenager. Hella hella hella hella HELL YEAH, let's dive in.

**RULE 1 - Sit Up Straight**
Posture may not seem significant, but it's helped me a whole hell of a lot. I feel more confident in my skin, and I feel like I have more of a presence in the space I'm in.


**RULE 2 - Drink an Assload of Water**
This one's pretty straightforward. Hydration homies wya 


**RULE 3 - Stuffed Animals are Fucking Dope**
This rule rings true for all 'strange' quirks and atypical interests though. It was junior year when I first started being super open with my interests around other people. Turns out when you share stuff, other folks will share goofy shit with you, and then you realize that most everyone is goofy in some way or another.


**RULE 4 - Don't Lie My Dude**
I didn't follow this one for a looooong time, but lying has caused me (and others) a lot more pain than any positives I would attain from lying. It doesn't feel good to realize you've been lied to, and it doesn't feel good to haunt yourself with a lie. 


**RULE 5 - Get a Good Night's Rest**
Another self-explanatory one, but it could be argued that this is the most important rule on here. The amount of sleep you get, and what your sleep schedule is can lead to a number of different occurrences. Bottom line: 


**RULE 6 - Life's a Bitch, but It's Your Bitch ;0**
Ahhh, my favorite personal motto. To break it down, essentially what this means is that, at the end of the day, life might suck in the moment, but things DO get better. They get a lot better much faster, however, if you take the steps necessary to improve your circumstances, whatever those steps may be for you. 

**RULE 7 - IT'S OK TO ASK FOR HELP**
Hey man I get it, I'm a very independent person. I don't like asking for help when I don't need to, but sometimes I do it anyways. It never hurts to have an extra leg of support to stand on in times where you may need it most. This can be applied in *every* facet in your life.

**RULE 8 - Relentlessly Pursue Your Goals**
In the beautifully written words of Prince EA, ""if you *'kinda'* want something, then you're only *kinda* going to get the results you want."" I think about this statement every time I'm doing something difficult that's in the way of a goal I'm after, and Prince is absolutely right. Life only happens once, so where do you want to end up 2 years from now? 5 years? 10? 20? Somethin to think about. ( The Prince EA video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ja-n5qUNRi8 )

**RULE 9 - Embrace Suffering**
Mental health is a crucial facet of our well-being. There is a lot you can do to keep afloat, but sometimes you can't. Don't deny your circumstances though, face them with fortitude. Don't swim against the tide, swim with it, in other words. I'll refer back to rule 7 though: there is no shame in asking for assistance. Sometimes you're faced with something so novel or difficult that it feels impossible for you to go about it by yourself. 

**RULE 10 - Compare Yourself to Who You Were Yesterday, Not to Who Someone Else is Today**
This is also a rule inspired public figure, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson. I suppose this one could also be self-explanatory, but I'll explain it a bit anyways. It is perfectly ok not to be the best at something. As long as you're improving in the areas you want to improve in, that's forward progress, nobody else's forward progress matters in this context. And hey, maybe, eventually, you could be the best at something, and that takes persistence.


Aight that's all for now. I hope these rules help maybe even a tiny bit. I hope it wasn't too long, but that just about wraps up my time on this subreddit. I mean, I still have an hour left, but I'm sleepy as hell so imma head out. I'll probably still float around every now and again, but now I'm gonna be an ollllllllld man, gonna need a mf walker here pretty soon at this rate jeez

This can be applied in *every* facet in your life. **RULE 8 - Relentlessly Pursue Your Goals** In the beautifully written words of Prince EA, ""if you *'kinda'* want something, then you're only *kinda* going to get the results you want."" I think about this statement every time I'm doing something difficult that's in the way of a goal I'm after, and Prince is absolutely right. Life only happens once, so where do you want to end up 2 years from now? 5 years? 10? 20? Somethin to think about. ( The Prince EA video: ) **RULE 9 - Embrace Suffering** Mental health is a crucial facet of our well-being. There is a lot you can do to keep afloat, but sometimes you can't. Don't deny your circumstances though, face them with fortitude. Don't swim against the tide, swim with it, in other words. I'll refer back to rule 7 though: there is no shame in asking for assistance. Sometimes you're faced with something so novel or difficult that it feels impossible for you to go about it by yourself. **RULE 10 - Compare Yourself to Who You Were Yesterday, Not to Who Someone Else is Today** This is also a rule inspired public figure, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson. I suppose this one could also be self-explanatory, but I'll explain it a bit anyways. It is perfectly ok not to be the best at something. As long as you're improving in the areas you want to improve in, that's forward progress, nobody else's forward progress matters in this context. And hey, maybe, eventually, you could be the best at something, and that takes persistence. Aight that's all for now. I hope these rules help maybe even a tiny bit. I hope it wasn't too long, but that just about wraps up my time on this subreddit. I mean, I still have an hour left, but I'm sleepy as hell so imma head out.

233506,"Too scared/unable to get helpI know there's a lot wrong with me but I always hesitated in getting real help because 1. It will hinder my work (which is stupid because in the long term if I get worse, I wouldn't be able to work anyway) 2. It is very costly and lastly 3. Where I live, having problems with mental health is looked down upon and you tend to get shunned by family and friends...

A little backstory for anyone who would come across this and chooses to read on...firstly forgive me for my english, it's not the best. I grew up always being very socially awkward and I was bullied non stop and beaten up for looking masculine and not like a typical girl. This continued on until I started going to a private school where I enjoyed being one of the 'popular' kids for once. In between the time period of leaving my old school and going to the private school, I was treated for depression and prescribed medication which I never took (I can't remember if I refused them or my mother never gave them to me). However I thought of myself as 'cured' because I started losing weight and growing out my hair to look at least somewhat decent compared to before. I would binge and then purge but never realized this was a problem, in my head it was an effective way to lose weight and nobody at home questioned me either since I would just say I felt sick after eating too much then go to the bathroom to vomit out everything I just ate.

In the new school I was introduced to an older man through one of my friends and we ended up being in a serious relationship for several years. 2 years in I discovered that he was cheating and that was when I fell back into depression, having constant thoughts of suicide and paranoia. We still stayed together on and off for a few more years until I made the decision that enough was enough and I ended the relationship after not being able to trust him anymore.

Shortly after, I met another man who was perfect in my eyes - he was completely open about everything and I truly felt loved while I was with him. We were together for about a year, ending the relationship based on some stupid argument which had nothing to do with cheating. This time however I was not in any sort of emotional turmoil and moved on fairly easily.

Throughout the time I was with my 2nd partner, my first ex still kept tabs on me and told me he had never and would never date anyone else. In a moment of weakness and loneliness, I contacted him one day thinking maybe we could give it another shot. We were together for another 2 years until the same problems arised, him cheating, me being depressed and suicidal and eventually wanting out.

The next few years I stayed locked up at home not even meeting family and friends...just in a constant state of absolute misery, feeling the worst I'd ever felt to that point, no longer finding joy in anything. Somehow or another perhaps after realizing I couldn't continue being a burden to my poor parents anymore, I forced myself out of it and got a job where I could work at home and earn a living, not substantial but enough to support myself and not burden my parents who had both stopped working.

I still feel severely depressed and closing in on 30 years old with just a handful of friends (all of whom are either married or available to hang out with but my social anxiety prevents me from any real life interactions) and a job that just earns me about enough to survive. I rarely leave the house unless it's to buy groceries. Appearance wise, it's never consistent as I could go weeks binging on fast food and becoming overweight to starving myself and doing water fasts to go back to my original weight. My last facebook login triggered another suicidal attempt after I found out that both my exes have gotten married in the years I was doing absolutely nothing with my life, laying in bed staring hopelessly at the ceiling thinking of killing myself but not wanting to upset my parents who ultimately would be the ones to discover my dead body.

I feel embarrassed to have even typed this all out as I realize I could have just gotten it together but the thought of ending my life is constantly there...I never feel good enough or worthy to continue living... I want out but at the same time I'm too cowardly to do so. The few friends I have are aware that I have social problems but they don't know the extent of my depression and I have never once confided in them about it.

My family does not believe in depression, they are extremely religious and believe that any form of mental health issue can be 'cured' through prayer which is why the only person I've confided in is my mother who I don't want to bother much as she herself has burdens of her own so I tend to just act as if everything is normal even if the night before I was in my room slicing my wrists or leaving the house at 3am looking for a high enough building I could jump off from. I have scars on my arms that are partly from cat scratches so it's easy to make excuses for all the other scars that are there from cutting myself.

I grew up never being close to any of my siblings...somehow I always felt unwelcome to them and none of them has ever attempted to bond with me in any way. Being as socially awkward as I am I guess I can't blame them but there was one particular incident in which my older brother told me something that hurt me to my core and that I will never forget. Around the time I had left my old school and was severely depressed and acting out, stealing and spending money to gain friends but instead being bullied even more, my brother for whatever reason came up to me one day in the living room and said that I should end my life because nobody would miss me. It was one thing to be a punching bag in school but to have your own sibling tell you that you are completely worthless...it was just a really awful feeling.

I can't fault any of them though as ultimately I'm the one with all the mental health issues and I have yet to overcome my severe social anxiety. Now I'm at the point where I'm expected to marry and have children but instead I'm stuck at home trying to survive each day trying to suppress thoughts of killing myself. I don't even know how I would go on even if i did overcome all my issues as I now harbour thoughts of hating the idea of being intimate with either men or women and I don't ever want to have children.

If there's any way I could get help without incurring a ton of debt, I would be very grateful. I do want help. I don't want to spend my days crying in bed and thinking of how useless I am and plotting ways to kill myself. I want to be a useful member of society. I want my parents to be proud of me instead of being ashamed of having a child who's known to be a loner and doesn't ever leave the house. A complete loser.

Thought it was sort of funny - a girl had killed herself earlier in the year, and there were counselors and meetings, but when someone tries and fails... no mercy.  That wasn't the first time I felt close to the edge, but it was the second time I acted on it.

All the people told me I just needed to keep trying.  So I did.  I got my GED, got a job, went to college.  Once there, the same thing happened.  Isolated, miserable, and generally being a failure.  Being the clever one I was, I dropped out.  Thought it would make me feel better at the time.

Got a job.  Had it ruined by my cheating ex-husband who slandered me to the administrators, causing me to leap at the opportunity to quit.  Got another job.  Got promoted.

Despite producing results, no one apparently thought my method was worth emulating.  

I love work.  It makes me so happy, but I haven't found a single place that wasn't full of people just looking to stab you in the back, to rip you apart to satisfy their egos.  It makes me so sad.

174573,"On his death dateYesterday marked 13 years since my boyfriend was killed in a motorcycle accident. It’s always a bad day for me, however I usually have friends who will do things with me to keep my mind occupied on the good times. This year it’s different. I just cut all ties with a toxic friend group which cut out a good maybe 10 people from my life. I also am not as close with my ex-roommates so they’re both doing their own things. I have one friend who lives 900 miles away and is dealing with her own problems. The only person left is my friend who was just released from jail and is addicted to heroin. I spent the day alone. I planned out what I would do to end my life so I could have the same death date as my boyfriend. I just had to go see him one more time. I went to his grave and smoked a cigarette while playing Free Bird. That’s when I noticed a blue jay nearby. He’d fly closer and watch me and fly to another location near me and watch. He did it through the entire 9 minute song!! No one can convince me that it wasn’t him. I know he would want me to live.... I just don’t see the point of living anymore.",suicide,"On his death date.

She knows that when I “try to get better” it’s just escaping from the truth and reality. She knows that I will always relapse and come back to this place. Come back to her. She knows everything about me. She knows how pointless trying to live my life is. She knows that I’m only alive because of my family. She knows that she’s, I am, going to suffer for the rest of my life. She knows that this is the truth. She knows that when I’m “better” I’m just avoiding reality, waiting for that breakdown to push me into this hole again, pathetic, trying to climb out of here, you will always come back here, you are such a.

She knows the truth. She knows. You should listen to her. I’m listening. Yet she doesn’t know what to do either. She knows that you should be dead. But she knows you can’t die, cuz of your family. She does nothing yet everything.

You’re so “awww” when you try. When you try to convince yourself. When you think you can sorta, temporarily escape from me. You’re not. Cuz I know the truth. I know there’s no point to this. You’re trying so you can live one extra second without being a rotten flesh, useless, but so aware of herself, that’s her only shining, still not sparkling so faint, piece of evidence of existence.

That she knows. At least she knows. Don’t you hope you didn’t? But we can’t go back anymore. You knew your destiny then, and there’s no way of forgetting about it. Oh, you won’t forget about it, you’ll just discover it again.

Oh wow. Hope you get kidnapped by an alien or something. Oh no. That’s hurting your family too. Wow, you can actually hurt someone like you’re that important, funny cuz you’re not.

Not everyone is worthy of being called mentally-ill. You’re not. You know your mind is pretty fucked, but that’s just the natural outcome of your life, oh yeah, the life that didn’t have to be this pathetic but you ruined it. But whatever. You’re gonna discover the truth anyway. Whatever. Is your mind fucked? Well, it has made you such a useless breathing organism for sure. Mentally ill, no. Mentally ill or not, you’re the same at core, your truth doesn’t change. You’ve just discovered it too soon, and you’ve done such a terrible job outside of it that it’s so hard for you to cope with facts.

Waste of all. “You sound depressed.” Doesn’t matter. Doesn’t make a true difference at the end of the day. Just makes me more useless. Oh, what a human. “Mentally ill.” No, you don’t get to get that. Unworthy. It’s reserved for others, not you, not YOU, you, you, you, you. You should die. You. Me. I shouldn’t be here. Shouldn’t be alive. But being dead is a privilege too. You don’t get to die. You’re here to suffer. And I’ll watch you pathetically struggle, “try”. It’s such a boredom of a show. Aren’t you tired? So repetitive. You’re always gonna come back here. You’re just living second by second, one more second of still living, one more second of avoiding to face the truth.

Oh and I know what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna try to fight this “demon” now. You’re gonna find “flaws in my logic”. Oh I’m sorry for being so straightforward I just wanted to get to the fucking point so I made it simple for ya. Continue. You’re gonna convince yourself that most of what I said “could be” wrong.

I know this is a sad moment in life, but please believe me when i say, this is for the better. I havent been happy with myself or my decisions for a very long time. For years ive felt alone and unwanted. Even the times when i wasnt alone, those where the times i let myself be used and lied to over and over again. These moments where not ideal, but they made me feel something when i couldnt feel anything. Good, bad, pain, or pleasure, it was something while i was starved and feeling nothing. No one is to blame for this but myself. I let myself fall prey to others and their own sins. When i needed people the most, i was shunned, called weak, dramatic, and shouted at. I agree with all of those statements, for they came from the people who knew me best. Everyone will say i should have came forward with my depression and feelings. I did, but i was always cut short by others and their issues. I put everyone before myself, i dont regret that. I made many people smile when they're hope was gone. I made many people laugh, and forget their problems for a brief moment. All the while, i just wanted someone to do the same for me. I've made many mistakes, both for myself and for others. For that i am truly sorry. Many battles have come and gone throughout my life wearing the uniform. Some are sources of courage, others the core of nightmares. I have soaked the dust covered ground with the hot blood of my adversaries, as well as seen my brothers in arms fall and be forgotten. This haunts me every night. Waking in the late hours, sweat soaked, and in tears. I cry alone for my sins. I hate the man ive become, but putting on a great show has always been a talent for me. I hate the atrocities that ive carried out. Every endeavour i have ever undertaken has always ended in failure. Yet, the failures have never been dealt by my own hand. Others have always seen to that. I can truly say that i really tried, but the world seemed to have its own plans for me. I wish everyone that was close to me the best, and happiness in all of their lives. Please succeed where i have failed, please live where i have passed. I have slowly planned this over time, and made absolutely sure this is a way for me to end my suffering. My greatest fear and sorrow is that the people who distanced themselves from me will have regret. I do not want this, i only want happiness for them. My life has ended, and i only wish for them to not follow on my path of sorrow. Live your life like its the greatest. Im too broken to be fixed. I have been slowly disassembled for years now. Along the way, some have tried to put my pieces back together, only to abandon them when something better or easier comes along. Im a mess, a disaster, and i only want to not be a burden to anyone anymore. I feel helpless, i feel lost, i feel shattered. I am not the man i was years ago.

313401,"I'm tired of existingI am a 23 year old woman with absolutely no reason to stay alive. I've had mental health issues since my early teens, and eventually had to dropout from high school as my mental health was deteriorating and made it impossible for me to attend classes. I still managed to pass my high school diploma a few years later and was supposed to go on to study at university in order to get a Bachelor's degree, but changed my mind at the last minute due to lack of motivation and some other reasons.

I don't have a job and never had one, though I'd like to work, if only to drift away from my constant negative thoughts.

Unsurprisingly I come from a dysfunctional family. My father has always been emotionally abusive to me, I highly suspect he might be a narcissist but he would never admit it. My brother has always hated me, my relationship with him is nonexistent and has always been.  I haven't talked to any of them in years although we live under the same roof. My mother is essentially the only person I talk to, she genuinely loves me and has always supported me when others gave up on me, but she tends to be emotionally manipulative so I avoid talking to her most of the time. Moving out would surely be beneficial to my mental health, but I am stuck living with them due being unemployed. My family is estranged from each other so I don't have any contact with my extended family.

I haven't had any friend irl in almost 8 years and that probably won't change anytime soon.  I am very introverted by nature and am used to being alone, but life feels meaningless when you have nobody to share moments with.

My love life is nonexistent, I've never even had a legitimate boyfriend. Ironically I'm not even ugly, I've been called pretty many times and a few guys have been interested in me before, but my mental health issues made me give up on trying to date.

I've been committed to a psych ward a few times, and was forced to take meds against my will for years. I'm convinced the meds I was on have caused permanent damage to my brain. It left me with constant brain fog which prevents me from thinking clearly.

I've had suicidal thoughts on a daily basis for the last 3 years. Last year I reached a non return point and bought supply to kill myself. My plan was to do it by the end of 2019, but things didn't turn out as planned and I had to postpone my date. I probably won't die this year either because of the coronavirus going on.

I have absolutely nothing to live for. I want out asap.",suicide,"I'm tired of existing. I am a 23 year old woman with absolutely no reason to stay alive.

268965,"I’m going to kill myself in a month.It’s not my first time on this subreddit but hey, I still want to kill myself so that’s cool, haha.

I’ve planned to kill myself on August 31st, a few days after my birthday. I’ve written my note and will in advance because I know that I’ll leave it till last minute and then back down. I’ve written about my funeral and I’m starting to give my things away. 

I just really want someone to care. People say they do but I don’t believe them; I want to but I feel so invalidated by myself. I’ve just deleted all my social media accounts after shameful posting about my mental breakdown, which has been on going for the past months, on snapchat for everyone in my family, all my friends and everyone i went to high school with to see.

I’m embarrassed that I’ve let myself get like this. I’ve tried telling my therapist that it’s not just anxiety that I’m dealing with. I don’t know what it is but I can’t do anything. I’ve lost all motivation; I loved writing, I always wanted to write poems and stories even though my family and friends discouraged from it as I won’t end up being famous and I won’t make any money. An hour ago, I threw away everything to do with the story I’ve been writing for the past 3 years. A story I spent every night trying to complete even though I had exams and other things going on. All because I don’t think I’ll make it as an author if I’m going to kill myself.

I attempted suicide in March, 2 days before my big Drama exam. Unfortunately, it didn’t work. I tried to jump off a bridge which had a river under it but all that I ended up with was soaking wet clothes, a badly bruised leg and less dignity than I started the day with. Guess you would call me lucky but frankly, I never felt like I was.

I want to talk to the people in my life about this. But I can’t. Everyone in my life is very judgemental about mental health, especially suicide. I try to type the words on text but my mind screams at me. I doubt that my therapist actually cares too.

I could write more but I don’t think I deserved to be helped? Until the 31st, I’m going to continue to isolate myself away from my friends and hope to god I die by then.",suicide,"I'm going to kill myself in a month.It's not my first time on this subreddit but hey, I still want to kill myself so that's cool, haha.

26421,(I’m safe and not doing anything) I just get these thoughts of putting a gun to my head more and more. I’m not suicidal but concerned. Help?I’ve been having insane anger issues this last year especially. I have this reoccurring thought of putting a gun to my right temple and pulling the trigger. Always the same thought. Never anything different. A year ago I had the key to my gun cabinet in my had ready to pull out a pistol but put it back and cried and didn’t tell anyone. I tried therapy online and going to try telehealth with a real therapy office. I’m just so full of anger and it feels like everything I succeed at I need to fight tooth and nail. It feels like everyone’s out to get me and I’ve had to stand up for myself to often recently. People have tried to talk down to me and I corrected them and blocked them from my life. I need the least amount of stress possible and need to be treated with respect that I wasn’t given or even able to talk with these people I’ve had issues. I’m just scared about this reoccurring thought because I don’t want to kill my self I have a lot of great things in my life. I am just depressed and it’s hard to enjoy all the bright things and successes when you’re getting kicked while you’re down whenever possible.

Stuff that I used to enjoy I stopped enjoying it too. I used to get real joy from playing video games now I hate them. I used to enjoy well.... nothing else but still these days I am just stuck in some deep languor. I watch tv shows or yt videos all day while getting no real enjoyment from it. I have a lot of stuff and work to do but still I waste my time doing this. I guess I don't like confronting the issue so I just beat around the bush

I haven't found real joy doing anything or I haven't liked doing anything since a year or two

This is what I posted on a venting-support discord server but I didn't post the part I am writing below. I didn't wish to write about suicide there.

My relationship with my parent's isn't the same anymore. We always had a very guarded relationship where I did not try sharing anything negative with them because it would always end up making myself feel shittier about myself. I have been thinking of killing myself everyday for at least a month and I. I looked online and people said I should open to my parents about it. It completely back-fired. They started saying I am good for nothing and won't be capable of doing anything. My parents basically echoed the thoughts I had been having in my head. My dad told me why can't I be normal like other kids. Why can't I go to school enjoy it, talk to other kids, get good grades, pursue hobbies, play sports. Now I am really serious about killing myself because now I have no one to talk to or fall back to. I have friends but I know none of them are real and good friends. I try to talk to them about this and they just say ""why can't I be happy and normal"". I live in India so any awareness about mental-health is non-existent. My dad refuses to take me to a therapist and I don't know what to do anymore. I haven't done any work in 3 days and I just sleep to numb these feelings.

316034,"Need help with finding a doctorAlthough I'm not suicidal right now, I have been in the past, but I figured I need to see a doctor now before it gets bad again. Which it does seem to be starting up again: numbness, brain feels numb/fuzzy (sometimes I even feel disconnected from myself) and I'm unable to concentrate, irritated, becoming more reclusive, etc.

The thing is, I don't know how you ""find"" a doctor, especially after moving. And people have told me different things: go see a psychologist, or a psychiatrist, or a neurologist, etc.

I've been to a psychologist several times throughout my life, but the last time I went to one was back in high school (5 years ago) because of my parents divorce. Of course, I remember lying to the doctor a couple of times because I felt better and figured I didn't need his services.

Another thing is I have trouble explaining stuff to a doctor about the way I feel and that if I did tell them something they wouldn't believe me. I guess that is the reason I don't want to go.

I have insurance so I'm not worried about payments or anything. And I know that I'm not supposed to give out a lot of personal info, but if it helps I am now in the Marietta area of GA.

Thanks, r/sw.

222593,"How do I finally get friends? If you base the idea of me getting rejected by women not being on my looks, there are definitely a few reasons in the back of my mind I think I’ve been trying to avoid. 

1. I have lack of friends or lack of *good* friends. Real is subjective because for everyone real friends come and go.

2. I never could approach and feel the anxiety can be extremely painful. This naturally seeps into every area of my life. 

3. My past and how people have treated me sometimes catches up to my present regardless of whether I’m a changed man, feel like one, or even seem different to others thus making me even more paranoid and anxious. 

4. I was bullied and rejected from a lot of potential friendships in my school days. This has led me straight to a life of isolation and spending 95% of my days alone and I *know* this to be the main bout of my insecurities.

I also have made some good connections at work but sometimes I use that as a distraction and an excuse to make any real friends or connections.

I’m now 22 so not strictly so much a teenager anymore, but I guess I still feel like one in the way I behave act, but mostly react to people socially and my situation of feeling so rejection and carrying a lot of pain.

Does anyone have any solutions to this and has anyone ever escaped similar issues?

Also lastly I don’t want to manipulate anyone into thinking I just want friends so I can have a girlfriend. I just know this is one of the most serious situations I am lacking in my life that could turn my life on it’s head in a good way and open the door to serious relationships with women, as most after being told wouldn’t touch a guy with no friends or lack of friends with a ten foot pole. So with that in mind. Any ‘cure’ per say or reasonable advice would be appreciated. Realise I spent a lot of my life alone and rejected also.

I made another previous rant expressing how I felt like it was other people’s insecurity that someone prefers to spend a lot of their life alone rather than us particularly. But I know deep down that that is not the full truth and I want to fix it.

Sometimes the *pain* of my current reality ends up becoming more painful than defying my anxiety and doing what needs to be done in order to fix those situations. That’s why I’m ranting and venting so much on my profile letting go and trying to find all the self help I can. However some can be untrustworthy and immoral so it can be very difficult to feel like I’m escaping. Like I’m running but I’m just running on a treadmill.

Before everything, happy new year, there's always something awaiting for you to stay alive, love you all. 
Not native English speaker and I'm on mobile so please forgive my writing, please!

So, there's this girl who I've been talking since 2019 November. We've been chatting daily since may and, oh boy, she has helped me A FUCKING LOT. Of course I still wanted to die, I had a terrible crisis almost every month when I didn't want to stay alive but... 

She came to my city to celebrate my birthday, that was the 22nd. The last day I still wanted to kill myself was the 24th. SHE STAYED TO DINNER AT CHRISTMAS WITH MY FAMILY! And everything goes... Smooth, my mind is plenty of her, she is making me SO FUCKING HAPPY, but the best of all: She makes me a better person, her existence makes me want to be... Better. Stronger. 

On Monday, the 28th, I became her boyfriend. She left my city that same day. Now, in a long distance relationship, I just think of when are we going to see each other again, to kiss her, to hug her and there's simply no time to think... In killing myself.

Before everything, happy new year, there's always something awaiting for you to stay alive, love you all. Not native English speaker and I'm on mobile so please forgive my writing, please! So, there's this girl who I've been talking since 2019 November. We've been chatting daily since may and, oh boy, she has helped me A FUCKING LOT. Of course I still wanted to die, I had a terrible crisis almost every month when I didn't want to stay alive but... She came to my city to celebrate my birthday, that was the 22nd. The last day I still wanted to kill myself was the 24th. SHE STAYED TO DINNER AT CHRISTMAS WITH MY FAMILY! And everything goes... Smooth, my mind is plenty of her, she is making me SO FUCKING HAPPY, but the best of all: She makes me a better person, her existence makes me want to be... Better. Stronger. On Monday, the 28th, I became her boyfriend. She left my city that same day. Now, in a long distance relationship, I just think of when are we going to see each other again, to kiss her, to hug her and there's simply no time to think... In killing myself.

55758,"I don't know how much longer I can do thisUsing my nsfw alt cuz fuck it 

I know that I have shit to live for. I'm an honors level college student in an accelerated graduate program, I've got a loving mom and a few friends. And every day feels so fucking pointless I can't find a reason to get out of bed anymore. 

I struggle with codependency and I tend to latch onto one person. For two years, that person was my girlfriend who broke up with me back in September because I was too much and making her unhappy. She cheated on me just before the breakup too (we had an open relationship but with certain specific boundaries, one of which she broke and then tried to say it wasn't cheating) and it all fucked me up. I needed her and she was shit to me. At first I couldn't stay away from her. I wasn't respectful of her boundaries. But eventually I went no contact and then she wouldn't respect me and I eventually had to get a university no contact order against her. Now if either of us tries to talk to the other, we would get in trouble with the school. 

In the pain of all of this, I let my emotionally abusive ex boyfriend back into my life. I was at a pretty good point in my breakup recovery and he wanted to apologize and I wanted answers. It really seemed like he'd changed. We started pursuing a friendship with benefits and things felt really good for about a month. Until I found out he had a girlfriend, felt pressured into sex with me, had sexual trauma that I caused when we were 13 (we're 21 now; he's been in my life on and off for that long) and was so shitty to me when we were younger at first because he thought if he pushed me away he could kill himself in peace, but then it was just because he hated me. 

I have a bad tendency to be obsessive. I'll stare at my phone for hours waiting for a reply, the whole time wondering why I wasn't good enough to get a reply. I'm still talking to the ex boyfriend. I'm badly trauma bonded to him and he's one of the only people I've been talking to in quarantine. But I feel like I'm just a burden to him. He tells me that that's not how that works, that I'm not gonna push him away by being too much, but that's how it worked for 8 years and that fear doesn't just go away. Last night I was feeling really bad and he wasn't replying, but I saw he was on Steam, not because of his online status (he always keeps it offline) but because I literally had his profile up and was refreshing, watching the playtime tick up and eventually watching him switch games. I called him, first time he hung up, second time he picked up cuz he knows I wouldn't call twice unless it was bad. And it was bad. I'd been crying and breaking down about how much I hated myself. He had been on a call with another friend and I felt so guilty for taking him away from her. So we talked for a bit and he calmed me down and then went back to her and said he would play it by ear in terms of talking to me after (we usually stay up pretty late gaming and talking). I sent him a couple more messages and couldn't sleep, waiting for him to come back. He never did. 14 hours later and he still hasn't

The only thing that makes me feel any better is him. And even then, it's just a matter of time before I feel like he hates me again. Or that he's here out of obligation. Or that he lets me down again. Or that I'm coercing him.

I've always been a lot. I monologue and soliloquize and I need a lot of reassurance a lot of the time. I can be coercive and pushy and I don't always know how to turn it off. I'm bitchy and lash out. And I thought I was getting better but after last night I'm not sure anymore.

There's a comment one of his friends jokingly made on his Steam profile in the style of an obsessive girl who can't take the idea of not being with him. It's a cruel irony that I have to look at it every time I'm on his profile. I hate that I do it. I know it just makes me miserable. But I can't seem to stop. 

I keep seeing the face of the poor girl he was dating the night I found out. I keep thinking that if I hadn't been part of his life, they could've just been happy. My ex girlfriend has a new girl, she doesn't need me. My best friend and I barely connect anymore. I have no fucking reason to get out of bed anymore. If you think this fucking post is bad in terms of length, imagine how it is to try to be my friend! Imagine how it is to try to put up with this shit! It sucks and no one fucking can! I tried reaching out to another friend last night when ex bf wasn't replying and she stopped replying when I said I was really starting to struggle. She was the one I went to during the whole breakup and it was too much for her. I push everyone away because I'm just too fucking much.

I went through some depression when I was in my teens (I'm in my 20s) and used to be afraid to be alone, but then things picked up as I got to be more social and express myself better.

Now it's getting bad again. It seems to crop up if I date someone. I always keep people an arm's length away, and when it seems like I might be getting closer, I start pulling away and then I deal with the breakup and feeling down and spiral again into something dark, sleep a ton, find it hard to exercise or focus on my career or any of the hobbies I like.

I had to beg my parents for 1 year to get a gaming pc which was only $600, when my sister asked for a laptop she got it within a week even tho it was $1200. It’s always been her word over mine for my parents. If she called me an idiot and I called her something back, it would instantly be my fault. Its just so fucked up.

Like that I thought was obviously a hint.

Though the sacrifice I had to pay in order to change for the better, was that I cut most of my negative contacts and only stayed with a few people close. Which sadly didn't last long. I barely hang out with people, I wish I could, I wish I could be outside, do some stupid stuff. Or just having a great time. I really feel as if I'm wasting my teenagehood, I'm still progressing and trying to become a better version all the time. But what's the point of being a good person when I can't share it? It's really hard at the moment to find new people, espacially during a pandemic, and at a school where pretty much everyone knows you, but don't want to deal with you. 

&amp;#x200B;

147343,"The dark placeHey there,

I was thinking about writing here for quite some time, but right now I just need some anonymous place for my thoughts. F 24yo, studying at university and struggling a lot with everything concerning this and the rest of life -- my nonexisting social life...
Last Tuesday, I tried to commit suicide. Had planned it quite some time ahead, even though I was a regular at my psychiatrist and my therapist. They knew about my depressing phase right now, but at one point I just couldn't get the feeling of ""it might be alright at some point, even if I can't see how"" anymore and I just tried to skip talking about this.
I wrote some mails to say goodbye to some people, finished some stuff I had to do so I would not leave and let some guys down that still required some tasks only I could finish due to responsibilities...
Well, I'm not even really sure, why I decided to write these mails, since in the end, they called the police, they found me unconscious at home and ambulance came... Well. I woke up at ICU and now I'm stuck in psychiatry...
I don't even know any more, how to feel about all that :/ I'm quite pissed that it failed. Suddenly, people care, suddenly, hypocritical, they speak up in my life, they are shocked... whatever. Nobody cares all the time. Now it's me, being in a dark place with no right to say that I don't wanna live anymore. Even the professionals here just say their positive stuff like ""I'm sure there will be some day and it will be fine"" and ""there is always a way""... But of course, nobody can say, how I should face the problems in reality. Nobody says how I should continue with failing big at university. My circle of friends is around 0, just sitting around at home, browsing reddit or whatever -- trying to face my exams, my anxiety kicks in and I don't sleep anymore, quivering all day, sweating... 
I don't know what to do. They keep me alive here, yeah. Wont try anything in here, cause it wouldn't work anyway. But I really can't see how hanging around here, maybe even trying some therapy at the clinic for some time should change something.

",suicide,"The dark place. Hey there, I was thinking about writing here for quite some time, but right now I just need some anonymous place for my thoughts. F 24yo, studying at university and struggling a lot with everything concerning this and the rest of life -- my nonexisting social life... Last Tuesday, I tried to commit suicide. Had planned it quite some time ahead, even though I was a regular at my psychiatrist and my therapist. They knew about my depressing phase right now, but at one point I just couldn't get the feeling of ""it might be alright at some point, even if I can't see how"" anymore and I just tried to skip talking about this. I wrote some mails to say goodbye to some people, finished some stuff I had to do so I would not leave and let some guys down that still required some tasks only I could finish due to responsibilities... Well, I'm not even really sure, why I decided to write these mails, since in the end, they called the police, they found me unconscious at home and ambulance came... Well. I woke up at ICU and now I'm stuck in psychiatry... I don't even know any more, how to feel about all that :/ I'm quite pissed that it failed. Suddenly, people care, suddenly, hypocritical, they speak up in my life, they are shocked... whatever. Nobody cares all the time. Now it's me, being in a dark place with no right to say that I don't wanna live anymore. Even the professionals here just say their positive stuff like ""I'm sure there will be some day and it will be fine"" and ""there is always a way""... But of course, nobody can say, how I should face the problems in reality. Nobody says how I should continue with failing big at university. My circle of friends is around 0, just sitting around at home, browsing reddit or whatever -- trying to face my exams, my anxiety kicks in and I don't sleep anymore, quivering all day, sweating... I don't know what to do. They keep me alive here, yeah. Wont try anything in here, cause it wouldn't work anyway. But I really can't see how hanging around here, maybe even trying some therapy at the clinic for some time should change something.

I fuck everything up though, I can't do anything right. I can't tell someone ""Hey don't curse or I'll have to kick you""(from a game, I'm a mod) I can't go to school because just talking to people is fucking hard so I left and take online classes, even emailing my fucking teachers prove to be fucking hard and such.

I always have to help my mom, her back hurts a lot and her legs give out on her, she walks using a walker, we didn't have much money but we finally got it because she was tired of falling down and hurting herself when her legs give out. Dad doesn't want to help her, or his son for that matter. He gets mad when he has to go get my brother from school or work. One time my mom was asking him for help on something and he said ""Ugh I didn't agree to this"" and they then had an argument about how he is suppose to since they married the ""through sick and health"" thing he agreed.

I have to take care of her because no one else will. That and I have to help grandpa now because she is unable to. Grandpa likes doing things for himself though, so he isn't usually putting a lot of work on me.

Doing this work doesn't bother me, it's taking care of my mom, how it affects us mentally. I do so much so I'm tired, I have a cat in my room that meows all of the time so when I am not doing anything it's hard to sleep. In the summer it's too hot here, so I try to leave my door open but I can't because of the cat.

I'm so tired and not sleeping finally had it's affect on me and I am getting more on edge and just exhausted.

I have an illness also, not just my mom. It's watching her get hurt )when she falls mainly) that makes me so sad.

I have an illness, and sometimes I just think... ""Why me?"" The typical thing of being like so fucking unfair that these things have to had happened to me. Illness is painful, okay? It hurts. It's four AM for me currently, I couldn't sleep because I've done something bad.

I just.. finally told him I couldn't be a mod much longer because I just... ugh. It's hard for me. I feel like I've disappointed him...

The rules have changed now because of me yet again.

When  can I jsut leave, just leave my life?

I hardly feel sorry for others. I feel sorry for those with situations like mine, illness with either a skin condition or back issues and they fall and such. I have this skin condition and it was a rash type thing but had lesions that were painful, also made me internally sick, vomiting, internal bleeding, stomach/kidney/heart pain.
Pain aftger surgery because they messed up and I wasn't on any pain killers for waking up. Feeling like I was ripped the fuck open.

Being in a wheel chair for months, ""friends"" ignoring me because I guess I was the weird person in the wheel chair. Scars all over my arms and legs from the skin condition that I always had to explain to others who judged. People judging when I had pills, mainly steroids (for the skin) because they didn't know. I mean, they didn't know, but they didn't have to judge like that still... After the illness was ""clear"" I still had (have to this day) joint pains. I have to live the rest of my life in fear of this coming back. It can come back any time. I always check my body for signs of it.

It's just a nightmare.

Speaking of nightmares, I have those. Some are normal things, being attacked or raped, some aren't normal, having to talk to certain people, having a car explode, losing our house. It's because those are more of realities for me, so it's scary... Our cars always break down because we can't buy a new car..

Had to spend time moving back and forth between my parents and my grandparents becasue they couldn't drive us anymore, cars were all broken down. I don't like the grandparents house...

I did like the bed, I nbever had one until this year, and it's a blessing.


I enjoy small things, since I don't have many big things. a bed is a big thing. a dresser. I got those two things this year. I have enough clothes to take two washes instead of just one, that'sm ore clothes I've ever had before. I can still fit them all in one big wash though...

So I have some good htings, but most of my life is shit.

I always hide how sad I am though. Is it ever a time I can just cry, and feel sorry for myself? Without feeling like shit for it? People can only handle so much, right? Am I jsut that stupid dramatic bitch if I cry? I've not cried for myself in so long, it's hard to bottle all of the emotions on the inside.

Really suicidal. Broke up with ex boyfriend a week and 2 days ago. No contact for entire duration except when i had to go get my stuff back from him and it was swift and we talked about nothing else. He was a bad boyfriend; no regrets.

I (21 f) lost my best friend (ex) in the process. I didn’t have anyone else and nothing to hope for except our lives together and the fun and adventures we had. I hate my home situation and living with my parents and siblings whom I hate a lot to the point where thats just whats making me suicidal because I have no distractions now. I just feel like there’s no point. I still live with them because I want to get a masters degree and have to save up for it so I can afford it but I don’t know if I’ll survive here any longer. 

Today was my first day of work and it was awful. They had nothing set up for me and forgot to forward important links and emails to me like I just suddenly walked in and got the job when in reality I’ve been in the process of getting hired since August so they knew I was coming and yet failed to have anything planned and I don’t have a district email (i work at a school) or anything and didn’t know shit and they hadn’t contacted me before either the damn fuck ups. I spent the day on the library floor reading because there was absolutely no work for me to do today which is their own fault because I was more than willing and ready to jump right in like I have in my previous jobs also in schools. 

At this point I feel really angry and mad and like there’s really no point. I get my masters and work and so what? What then? Same shit different levels. It really gets me wondering whats the point? Why not expedite the process? Everything feels so pointless to be honest and just so shitty. 

They want me to join in the classrooms through zoom tomorrow but the whore that printed my email information for me (she was supposed to forward it to me in august but didnt and i had to go twice to her today to get it because she kept forgetting) printed the wrong one and I can’t access anything and have absolutely no one to ask although I did email the head teacher showing her the printed paper and the chrome book screen saying it’s not the right email. I don’t know what the fuck they expect me to do now those fucktards.

I hate my parents and siblings so fucking much so so so fucking much if I had money and was graduated from my ba at least already id leave and never contact them again but I’ve been waiting my whole life for that window of escape and still it hasn’t come and I can’t leave now unless I’m okay with being homeless or in debt which I’d rather die than do.

In a way, I _am_ dying.

I am in therapy.

I'm really proud of him for being able to pick himself up so quickly. The whole time he was still constantly trying to help me even though he was the one that needed help. 

He told me the other day that he was saving up to buy me plane tickets to go see him for my birthday (May 17th) which I would really love to do.

I've gone through my fair share of ""unfair experiences"" and he's really patient with me and understands that I need to take things slowly. He's always there for me and tries his best to make me happy. I really like him and I think that he's different from most of the guys I've dated in the past which is a very good thing. He was recently evicted from his apartment (he lived on his own) and is now living with some roommates and is getting his bearings. I'm really proud of him for being able to pick himself up so quickly. The whole time he was still constantly trying to help me even though he was the one that needed help. He told me the other day that he was saving up to buy me plane tickets to go see him for my birthday (May 17th) which I would really love to do. Part of me thinks my parents wouldn't let me which makes me think I'm crazy. If he did and if I went I definitely wouldn't go alone because that's just crazy. I really want to meet him and see if this could be something other than just two people texting but I just don't know if I have the right judgement... I really need some advice. Do you think this is crazy and I'm just a dumb kid or should I try and see this through..?",non-suicide,0.72971904,0.28352496,0.42901105,0.59319973,0.38195193

There is no clear indication that you might have a

psychopathic / antisocial personality disorder.

You reached, however, 50,00% of Factor 1 which captures the core personality traits of psychopathy that define the interpersonal and affective deficits of this personality disorder (e.g. shallow affect, superficial charm, manipulativeness, lack of empathy) and that are correlated with narcissistic personality disorder, low anxiety, low empathy, low stress reaction and low suicide risk. But Factor 1 is also associated with extraversion and positive affect - affected persons usually score high on scales of achievement and well-being, so some aspects of the personality disorder may even be beneficial for the psychopath (in terms of nondeviant social functioning or if it comes to profit from manipulation or lies).

You reached, however, 22,22% of Factor 2 which captures the traits of antisocial behavior (e.g. criminal versatility, impulsiveness, irresponsibility, poor behaviour controls, juvenile delinquency) and is associated with reactive anger, social deviance, sensation seeking, anxiety, increased risk of suicide, low socio-economic status, criminality, and impulsive violence.

You reached, however, 100,00% in other relevant traits that can indicate this personality disorder.

You might have certain traits of antisocial or psychopathic personalities but certainly not in a form that would justify a personality disorder diagnosis according to the standards.

Score: 16 of 38 \[16:8/4/4\]

There are strong indications that you might have a

narcissistic personality disorder.

There are slight differences between the major diagnostic manuals in how to diagnose a narcissistic personality disorder, with the ICD-10 manual stating that a person may only be diagnosed with a Narcissistic Personality Disorder if she/he does not meet the diagnostic criteria for a dissocial (antisocial, psychopathic), histrionic or any of the other personality disorders at the same time. For the DSM-IV manual, there is no such exclusion. It is unusual for NPD personality types to seek therapy, as they unconsciously fear exposure or inadequacy and will usually disdain therapeutic processes or the idea of psychotherapy itself, sabotage the therapeutic process or openly oppose it. Pharmacotherapy is rarely effective.

Score: 5 of 9

&amp;#x200B;

There is no indication that you might have a histrionic personality disorder.\[D:4/I:3\]

&amp;#x200B;

You meet 100% of the range of general personality disorder criteria.

This further indicates that you might have to deal with a severe personality disorder.

Thus, is strongly recommended you seek a professional diagnosis to be sure what exactly you are dealing with.

188158,"Planning my suicide and my will.Today I feel like I really fucked up. I don't want to go into details about what I did cause most people who say I'm over reacting. To put it simply; I annoyed the person I love and care for the most in my life and I don't know if they'll ever treat me the same. This is honestly the last straw for me. 
After realising this I had a mental breakdown. It started an avalanche of negative thoughts. I thought things like ""nobody actually loves you"", ""you deserve to feel like this"", ""are you going to cut yourself again? This time I want you to bleed"", ect. It was the most I had cried in years. I finally thought, ""should I actually kill myself?"".

187301,"Hope you guys enjoy my stories  

he sun was just beginning to set as I paddled into the Okefenokee swamp along with my friends, Hank and Lucia. We weren't strangers to kayaking in the swamp; we had all done it since we were kids. Even at night, we weren't afraid to go in with the alligators and the birds and the other wildlife. This trip in particular, however, was designed to be scary. What a better time to tell ghost stories than while camping in the swamp on Halloween? We'd never spent Halloween in the wilderness before, and we figured it would be better than going to another costume party. I love being able to get away from my job at the Foundation every once in a while. The cold, sterile halls of Site 327 have no soul, none of the romantic power that nature does. As much as I love science, I need that kind of spiritual peace that nature imparts.

Things started to get dark around 6.

""Lights on everyone,"" said Lucia, as if we were kids that needed her to order us around. Hank looked at her and pouted.

""But I don't wanna!"" he whined.

""Come on Hank,"" I said, ""we better do what she says, or she'll spank us.""

The look on her face was enough to send us both into a fit of laughter.

""Shut up Joe,"" she said. ""I don't know which one of you is worse.""

We kept mostly silent after that, paddling our way to our campsite. We'd been there many times before, an island of solid earth in a sea of stagnant water, peat, and trees. Spanish moss waved lazily in the wind as true darkness finally came, obscuring the already alien shapes of the Okefenokee. Here was true wilderness. No humans came here frequently, and when they did they never stayed long. The trees grew large and twisted, silent surveyors of the affairs of fish and fowl, alligators and snakes. We tied up the kayaks, set up our tents quickly, stowed our gear, and built a fire. As we cooked marshmallows and hotdogs, now came the reason we had come out here in the first place, our first-ever Halloween swamp ghost story contest. Hank took the first turn.

*A few miles south of Folkston, back in the 1800s, there used to be a place called Trader's Hill. It was a traders' town, of course, built near the water. There's an enormous old oak tree there, still around today. People called it the Hangman's Oak, for reasons I'm sure you can imagine. So one day, this Indian named Suanee came to town. He got accused to stealing some goods from a trader, and he ended up being sentenced to death. So they brought him up to the Hangman's Oak, and they were tying the rope around his neck when he said ""May the curse of my father's spirit and my own be upon you, for as long as there is a Trader's Hill!"" No one payed him any mind, and they hanged him dead.*

*About a month later, the people of Trader Hill were having a dance to celebrate the harvest, when they saw something bright in the distance. They all looked toward it and saw Hangman's Tree, glowing bright like it was on fire, and they could hear wailing and moaning like a thousand people being tortured! The next morning the first group of people packed up and left Trader's Hill. Eventually, the whole place was deserted. They say that sometimes, at night in the fall, you can still hear the wailing of Suanee and his father.*

""Hank, I'm sorry but that story was just awful,"" I said, ""It wasn't scary, and I'm pretty sure I've heard it before somewhere.""

""What!? That story scared the shit out of me when I was a kid!""

""Nope. Wasn't scary.""

""I agree. Boooring."" said Lucia.

Hank stared at us both, flabbergasted. Before he could say anything, I saw it. There was a light in the swamp, like an orange flame. It was far off, and obscured by the fog, but I could see that it was bobbing along like someone carrying a lantern. Who would be out in the swamp at night? And how do you just causally walk through the swamp?

""Hey guys, do you see that?"" I asked.

""See what?""

Almost as soon as they turned, the light disappeared.

""What was that?"" said Hank.

""I don't know. Maybe it was just someone setting up their own campsite?"" suggested Lucia.

""I guess…"" I said. I was used to seeing weird things. Something about this didn't seem right. Still, it's my weekend off.

""Whatever, let's just keep going. I believe it's my turn,"" I said as I stood up.

*One day, a man named Henry Ferguson was driving home from work. It was another busy day in Chicago, with lots of traffic on the highway as people made their way home. Henry was tired, he had been working late the past couple of nights. He couldn't wait to get home and relax. Suddenly, his phone rang. He answered it.*

*""Good afternoon Mr. Ferguson. I have your son here at gunpoint. You must make a choice now.""*

*""What? Who is this?""*

*""That's not important. I can see you from a screen right now. Speed up, and turn into oncoming traffic. If you don't do it soon, I will kill your son.""*

*""Dad! Please, don't do it!""*

*""George? Is that you?!""*

*""Yes Dad, it's me, don't worry about me I'll be fine!""*

*""Shut up! Mr. Ferguson, you're running out of time.""*

*Henry heard a gun click. His heart was beating out of his chest. He didn't know what to do.*

*""George…..I love you.""*

*He stomped on the accelerator and turned sharply to the left.*

*Mr. Henry Ferguson didn't survive the crash. When the police asked for a recording of the last phone call he had made before committing suicide, they got it. To this day, no one knows who actually made the call, where it came from, or how George's voice was on it when he had never been kidnapped or threatened with a gun at all….*

I stood silent for a few moments while I let the last part set in. Hank and Lucia looked a little spooked now. I'm sure the Foundation wouldn't mind that I had made up a ghost story using an SCP for inspiration, but then they probably would never know.

""Dude, that's fucking creepy."" said Hank.

""That was one of the better ones I've heard recently,"" agreed Lucia. ""However, I think I've got both of you beat. Have a seat and listen to a true master of the art.""

*Long ago in England, there lived a man named Jack. Jack was a thief and a scoundrel, but a clever one. One day, for all his cleverness and carefulness, he got caught stealing a gold coin from a farmer. Half the village was chasing him with murder on their minds, for that coin was all they had. Jack jumped into some bushes on the side of the road and let the villagers pass by, then dusted himself off and started walking the other way. He hadn't gone more than a few steps when a dark figure stepped onto the path before him, appearing like a wraith from the fog.*

*""Jack,"" the figure said, ""I have come for thee. You hath lived a wicked life, and it is my duty as Satan, Lord of the Hell to take your soul to eternal damnation. Your time hath come, the villagers shall return and kill you soon.""*

*Jack, being the clever man he was, thought this over and had an idea. ""Devil,"" he said, ""would you not prefer to have many souls over one?""*

*""Are you proposing a deal, Jack?"" the Devil said.*

*""A small one, Devil. It would benefit you much more than me. It is simple, you shall see.""*

*""Tell me more, but be sharp, for your time runs short.""*

*""Well first, Devil, I but throw away this gold coin I stole, into the forest where the peasants will never find it. Then you, Devil, turn thineself into the same gold coin. You hop into my purse, and when the peasants find me I give you to them. They don't kill me, but you disappear from their pockets later, and soon enough they'll all kill eachother arguing over who stole it.""*

*The Devil agreed, and did as Jack said. But when he turned into a coin and hopped in Jack's purse, he found in there a crucifix. At the sight of it, the Devil's power was diminished, and he could not move from Jack's purse.*

*""A curse on you, Jack! You damnable wretch!""*

*""I will let you go if you do as I say.""*

*""Blasted fate! I submit. What do you wish?""*

*""I wish that you promise you will never drag me to Hell, never touch my soul, not ever.""*

*The Devil was reluctant, but as the peasants drew near, he finally gave in to Jack's demand. Jack threw him from his purse, and the Devil fled into the dark forests.*

*Finally, the farmers had Jack where they wanted him. They snatched him and bound him, and searched him for their gold. But they did not find it, for Jack had thrown it into the woods. Instead, they took his head.*

*Jack was now in a predicament, for it seemed that Heaven would not take him, on account of his wicked nature, but neither would Hell, for the Devil had made his promise. Trapped between worlds, Jack begged of the Devil for one thing. A light for him to see by as he wandered the Earth. Satan took pity on Jack, and gave him an ember from the fires of Hell itself. Jack took it, and placed it in a carved pumpkin that he now wears in place of the head he lost. Since, he became known as Jack 'o' The Lantern.*

I yawned. I saw worse things on an average Tuesday.

""Eh,"" said Hank, ""it was interesting, but not really scary. Kind of cheesy too. Pumpkin heads are so overdone.""

""What are you smoking? A guy with a pumpkin for a head with fire from Hell itself wandering the Earth for all eternity doesn't scare you?""

""No.""

""You're too jaded.""

A voice came from just outside the light of the fire. ""Oh, it's a good story. You just got a few of the details wrong.""

We all turned, startled, toward the voice as a man stepped into the light of our fire. He was old, his skin wrinkled with age. Half his hair had fallen out, the rest was grey as brushed steel. His eyes gleamed in the firelight, obscuring their color. He wore swamper's clothes, overalls and boots, but he seemed dirtier than most swampers I had seen.

""Who are you?"" I asked him.

""They call me Will."" He turned toward Lucia. ""If you had told that story right, it would have been much scarier.""

""You were spying on us?""

""Only for as long as her story lasted. I was just on my way in my canoe when I heard your voices.""

Lucia stood up. ""Well if you know that story so well, what did I get wrong?""

""Well, for one thing,"" said Will, ""Jack never lost his head. The villagers just hanged him. He pretended to be dead and then just got up and left as soon as they turned around.""

""For another, Jack didn't use a pumpkin to hold his Hellfire. There weren't any pumpkins in Medieval Europe, they're an American vegetable. He used a carved turnip.""

As he spoke, I saw the light again. There it was, closer this time, slowly bobbing left and right, left and right. There was another, and another, another…

""You also forgot the best part. Jack figured out that though his Hellfire would never go out, on some days it was stronger. Particularly one day. It's a day of significance, ancient and cursed. They call that day All Hallow's Eve, or more recently, Halloween."" The lights where closer now, more coming into view every second. I realized that Lucia, Hank and I had huddled together close, while Will was standing totally still, a knowing smile on his face. He casually rolled his head, revealing a white, puckered scar going all around his neck.

""Jack eventually figured out that on Halloween, his Hellfire was strong enough that he could use it to take people's souls for himself. All he had to do was use it to burn off someone's head. The Hellfire would spread to their necks, and burn on forever, trapping their souls and bending them to Jack's will.""

The lights were very close now, so close I could make out more details. They were faces. Carved faces. Jack-o-lanterns. One came into the light of the fire. A dark figure, wrapped in rotting cloth. It seemed taller than a person should be. On it's head, it wore a jack-o-lantern like a helmet. But that couldn't be right, there'd be no room for the head and the candle…

""I really like the way pumpkins look. Much nicer than turnips. Roomier too.""

One of the figures stepped closer. I looked into the pumpkin, searching for a face. All I saw was a stump of a neck, a small flame pouring out from the throat. The smell of burnt meat filled my nose.

""Oh, I almost forgot! in some versions of the story, they call him Will.""

I can still hear his laughter echoing in my ears. I'll never be able to forget that cackle of his, so deep it sounds more like he's choking. No matter how long I walk the swamps, day or night, rain or shine, I can never seem to get it out of my head.",non-suicide,"Hope you guys enjoy my stories he sun was just beginning to set as I paddled into the Okefenokee swamp along with my friends, Hank and Lucia.

As he spoke, I saw the light again. There it was, closer this time, slowly bobbing left and right, left and right. There was another, and another, another ""You also forgot the best part. Jack figured out that though his Hellfire would never go out, on some days it was stronger. Particularly one day. It's a day of significance, ancient and cursed. They call that day All Hallow's Eve, or more recently, Halloween."" The lights where closer now, more coming into view every second. I realized that Lucia, Hank and I had huddled together close, while Will was standing totally still, a knowing smile on his face. He casually rolled his head, revealing a white, puckered scar going all around his neck. ""Jack eventually figured out that on Halloween, his Hellfire was strong enough that he could use it to take people's souls for himself. All he had to do was use it to burn off someone's head. The Hellfire would spread to their necks, and burn on forever, trapping their souls and bending them to Jack's will."" The lights were very close now, so close I could make out more details. They were faces. Carved faces. Jack-o-lanterns. One came into the light of the fire. A dark figure, wrapped in rotting cloth. It seemed taller than a person should be. On it's head, it wore a jack-o-lantern like a helmet. But that couldn't be right, there'd be no room for the head and the candle ""I really like the way pumpkins look. Much nicer than turnips. Roomier too."" One of the figures stepped closer. I looked into the pumpkin, searching for a face. All I saw was a stump of a neck, a small flame pouring out from the throat. The smell of burnt meat filled my nose. ""Oh, I almost forgot! in some versions of the story, they call him Will."" I can still hear his laughter echoing in my ears. I'll never be able to forget that cackle of his, so deep it sounds more like he's choking. No matter how long I walk the swamps, day or night, rain or shine, I can never seem to get it out of my head.",non-suicide,0.7580566,0.26762334,0.48488635,0.54420084,0.09180264
4142,"It feels like I already diedI deactivated most of my social media a little over a week ago. I’m a guy that scrolls FB for several hours a day, and I just found it to be making matters worse so I deactivated it during a rather tense time with several people to try and escape. 

Well, I’m bored, and I know nobody will notice if I reactivate it again for a minute and just check how everybody is doing. The way everybody has just gone on with their lives, new profile pictures here and there and hardly recognizing some people after just one week offline. 

My best friends who never even noticed I had gone, and suddenly haven’t spoken to since, sharing regular posts every few hours. 

My big girl got a haircut and seems to be getting on fine with her cousins.

My mom, sister, and other family just sharing their memes and jokes as normal. 

My crush sharing events and things that are important to her but aren’t really my bag, further distancing me from getting the courage to talk to her. 

It feels like I died, and missed all these things. The regular same old, and the new. That this is what it would really be like if I could just take that fucking step. But I can tell myself nobody cares at all, but I know you guys here do. Or so you say.  I feel like the support we find here is all that keeps me going. And I guess that’s what’s important.

His legendary singing and dancing make him an icon even today, but, if you read my shit, then you know that all icons have skeletons in their closet.

Elvis may have been a singer, but he had a real passion for acting. Particularly, the acting of James Dean. James Dean was the real shit in the early 1950's. Everyone wanted to be him, and those who didn't wanted to fuck him. He died very young, and Elvis believed that he was meant to take his place, and was obsessive about it. 

Elvis memorized Dean's most famous work ""Rebel Without A Cause"" cover to cover (so to speak). He even got some parts in films, and almost one in Westside Story, but he always complained that they were ""too small for his talent."" Truth is, that he kinda sucked at it.

There was one things that truly showed his obsession with Dean. When he was alive, there were rumors that Dean was in a sexual relationship with a man named Nick Adams. Well, let's just say that Elvis may have thought that to be James Dean, he would have to fuck like James Dean.

Despite this rumor, there is really no doubt that he was heterosexual. His wife knew this. I'm talking about the woman that had a 10 year age gap with him (she was 14 when they met, which was legal at the time).

Hey, how about a game? Think of any Elvis song. Literally any one, and I will read your mind.

Got one? Alright...

Elvis did not write that song.

Go ahead and Google it if you don't believe me.

See?

It was actually pretty simple. I simply knew this because Elvis did not write a single one of his songs.

I feel like I'm not allowed to feel sad because I come from a very middle-class background and I feel like there are a lot of people that have much less than me and are fine living their day to day lives.

I always feel like I'm useless and the only thing I'm good at is making everyone around me sad. I also feel like everyone is judging me constantly.

That's all the relevant information I can think of for now. I'll add more to this post if I can think of anything. Feel free to give advice or ask question in the comments (I'll respond if I feel comfortable answering it).

I’ve spent the last 14 days without seeing or talking to a man that’s been there my entire life. It was harder than expected to be honest. 

I was on a bike ride today when I found out he was going to be home for a few minutes. I biked 3 miles in 10 minutes to see him, something I was excited for and hoped he was too. 

When I got there, the first thing he said was complaining about the status of the shed we were building in the backyard. Something we stopped doing because he wasn’t there. 

No hug, no hi, no I miss you. Just immediate complaining that I wasn’t productive in his eyes. 

Not something I was expecting, as something that hurt a lot. 

Sadness and anger are what I’m feeling. What a fucking shitty day.

339566,"I(24M) think I have dealt with enough to call it a life.Hi,

I am gonna quickly explain my life to you guys.

24 year old Indian male. Fell in love at the age of 17 to the most beautiful human being in the world, and I say that with all honesty. We've been with each other for roughly 6.5 years, steady.

Like every couple, we've had our fights, but mostly we grew up from theme, kept perfecting each other over the years and I'll always tell you that this is the most beautiful part of my life. We actually met online and our religions are different, both families conservative, hence eloping was mostly the best option for us and we always knew that.

As she is still a student, and I am working full-time, I have been planning the future once we elope. There is a job kept for her in the company I work and everything. Deposit for a different apartment and all the other things that you can think of.

Last year, I got diagnosed with Brain-Tumor and she stood by my side as I lost all my savings. This absolute gem of a woman, stood by me, watching me go through everything as I went through the painful ordeal that was my treatment. I begged her to leave the sinking ship but she stood close. Love of my life. Ever since that, I get diagnosed with certain side effects and are on heavy medication related to treatments and my mental health related stuffs. I am dealing with major depression, mood swings and a certain detest and fear for life. (I am under treatment, yes.)

Her college asked just her to come and do some work for the dean. The COVID cases in the city is 35,000+. And I said ""No, you shouldn't go."" She said the dean wasn't listening. And dumbass me said ""I'll fuck up the deans career."". Tweeted to the university. Put a story from a fake account on Instagram. My words weren't very kind. Deleted the tweet, as my GF cried asking me to not ruin her career. I forgot the Instagram story. Some teacher saw it, and she was the only one who was called in on Monday. She was obviously asked. She did manage to handle it somehow and is not in any trouble, but yes, I did harm her in ways I did not think was possible. I know I am a complete asshole for this.

Maybe if wasn't on so many medications for anxiety, depression and the rest of them that might have clouded my judgement, maybe, if I wasn't so afraid or something, I would have just sucked it up and things would have been better.

She said the relationship is over. Now, this was everything I had in my life.

I am 24 years old. I have never known any kind of love in life. All of it.

We have this shit called horoscope, and according to mine, I would be the reason for my parents death before I turned 13.

Age 0 through 13, I was a bad omen. I was going to be the reason for the death of my parents. Even though my parents were nice to me, the rest of the family hated the sight of me. I have never cut a cake in my life. Birthdays were constant reminder of another year losing your parents. Nobody wanted to celebrate my birthday.

I had some bad experience from teacher during the private tuition 12 through 14.

Had to watch my best friend of 17 years pass away in an accident when I was 17.

That's when I met my GF. The best of the best. We planned everything. We knew we were going to marry each other. We knew ours was one of those fairy tale romances. She made a man out of me. She made me whoever I am, the good bits.

23, I am getting diagnosed.

24, while almost getting out of the bed, I am losing her.

The treatments cost a lot of money and I think I can help to put my sister through college. Its not like my extended family loves me a bit after I turned 13 and saw that both my parents were alive, so, I don't think they care what happens to me. I have no direction in my life, and I am really tired.

I am tired of being an inspiration figure for kids, I am tired of faking a laughter, I am tired of putting people through the shit that my life is.

I don't want to end my life, no. But I don't think there is a life either. I'd rather be diagnosed terminally ill than be where I am right now.

With the last action, I think I have dealt with enough to call it a life.

282088,"Hello, goodbye.The crushing loneliness that fills my heart whenever I lay down to sleep is immensely irritating. I find myself merely wanting the physical presence of another human to mitigate my sorrow, however I cannot imagine that any sane human being would even want to be near me. In my own eyes I'm worthless and the whole world would be better off without me in it. People have tried to change my mind, family, friends, therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists. All of them have failed because my self deprecation has reached astounding levels. Only matched by my apathy for any given situation. I go over silly little scenarios in my head where I meet someone and we fall in love and for that brief moment of delusion I'm happy but then reality sets in and my false happiness is shattered. So I've learned to fake my emotions, I've gotten pretty good at it. You could ask anyone who knows me and they would assure you that I'm the happiest person they've met. My mask has become near flawless. I have long since outgrown my fear of death. The real thing keeping me alive is my own aforementioned apathy. I've talked to strangers about suicide. They see it as selfish and cruel and can't see why I would want to do that to my loved ones. I however see those very same loved ones as the cruel ones. They want me to continue to suffer simply so they don't have to be sad about my death? Wasn't this life given to me? Can I not choose when and how to end it? I never asked to be born. I never wanted this life. I just want to sleep.

The more I think about it the more I realize that this life is completely pointless. Why chase happiness when I can just die and not worry about it? People are always searching for their reasons to continue living but I'm one of the few who have just simply stopped looking. I realized some time ago that everything that society teaches us is in the end goal of passing on our genetic code. We go to school to get an education. So we can get good paying jobs. So that we can show to the opposite sex that we're a worthy mate. I couldn't care less about if I had children or not. My family name will most likely die with me. I wouldn't be a very good parent anyhow. I have too much anger, too much hate, too much darkness. Any offspring I would create would be even more psychologically damaged than I am. The only thing I truly want is my own death. There is no doubt in my mind that I will die by my own hands. I've already seen myself die hundreds of times in my dreams, and each time I wake up not short of breath and covered in sweat but calm and smiling because my own death comforts me. Knowing that I'll be dead soon and that the loneliness and anger will no longer consume my entire being is such an amazing thought. I have only ever self harmed once in my entire life. Part of me regrets it, not because of the scars or looks I get when people see them, but because I see self harm as a crutch. I understand a lot of people do it and it makes them feel like their in control of at least something. Among other reasons. I however would rather harm myself to the point of my life ending. The fact that I didn't, in my mind, makes me weak. I also regret it because now that I have drawn my own blood, I have this constant need to do it again. Blood and I have a very loving relationship. To me blood is intoxicating. The smell, the sight, the sound, the touch and the taste. I love them all.

I just *can't* do it right, I don't know why. I have ADHD, and none of the medications will fucking stick. 

I'm living with my parents because I don't know how the fuck to function in a normal environment (barring the fact that I'm 18). They said they understood if I failed classes, and it was okay, because what else could I do? I can't really function in a job setting.

Of course, now, they're going back on their word. I don't know how to tell them that I bombed 2/3 classes last semester, and am doing basically the same this. I think I'm starting to get the silent treatment, it's fantastic.

I'm probably going to have to wait weeks if not months to see another therapist, because my health care is a goddamn joke even in Canada.

I'm so tired of it. Crippling anxiety, depression, ADHD, some ambiguous misophonia/autism thing, *and* OCD. I'm really nearing the worst you can get of the genetic lottery. I thought I had *dealt* with this, I was okay for a while, and now it's just the same shit all over again. I was trying to get diagnosed to see if it could help with uni, but my psychiatrist basically was a jerkoff, and so the cycle renews itself. Too late for school.

I can't even try switching meds again because being off of them renders me absolutely non-functional. I have finals soon. I can't even do my fucking essays. Even if I try it makes absolutely no difference, sometimes I genuinely fear I'm just not meant to thrive in a life like this. I don't know.

I'm wrestling with a lot of confusion about whether I'm asexual and aromantic. In which case, I'm probably going to die alone anyways; everybody else has a special someone but I guess that's just not a thing either. Cool.

To top it off, both my sister and I are being plagued by chronic strange health issues that just nobody can figure out. 

I'm so tired of living. It's the same shit over and over again, on repeat, broken up by periods of waiting and deceiving almost-happiness just to be fucking beat back down again. The only thing is, unlike the last few times I suffered from absolutely debilitating depression, I really thought there *was* a future I could be happy.

Hello,
Just as a quick intro, I just wrote this up for no reason and then decided it was internet/novel ready. It's pretty long... Please ignore spelling and grammar errors. I am drunk.
I was originally going to put this on a mormon board and maybe it belongs there, but I'm plastered right now and suicide seems better, so pretend like you're a mormon to read this. Or if you just want a quick laugh, skip to the last line.
Anyway, I was born and raised a Mormon. I know everything about them and have nothing against them. It's a great religion if it happens to be a good fit for you. However I hate their EXTREME recruiting and retention tactics and despite my best efforts, I can't leave and it has cause me great mental stress to the point of near insanity and suicide. I consider myself agnostic now, but Mormonism is where my family roots are and I can't afford to leave, physically or mentally.

Before you read this and decide I'm a bad person, I have improved greatly since my lowest point in my ethics, morals, and substance abuse, though I am still having life-threatening issues with depression and anxiety. All I want to do with my life is to help people and live in a good enough manner that no matter what happens after death, I'll finally have a chance at being content and actually experiencing the true ""joy"" that you hear about at church all the time. Money doesn't matter to me, things don't matter to me. I treat everybody with respect and love and I just don't understand why many people can't see the logic of the golden rule. To me, it's just common sense.
The acts of terror and war in our world lately hurt me on a level that it seems fewer and fewer people can fathom. I am empathetic to the individual who is killed in these attacks wondering why somebody would kill just to make an example. I am also empathetic to the martyrs, murderers, or terrorists who were perhaps mislead to believe that killing imperialist Americans (or any other country that suffers from this) is the way to heaven and shows their absolute comradery and brotherhood to the religious group that took them in and gave them purpose. Whether or not they second guess their decision, everyone else sees it as a call to arms to initiate more violence. No teachings, even radical Islam, tell people to kill those who they don't agree with. They may idealize martyrdom, but not murder. The theory that I believe most accurately describes terrorism and why this happens is that they consider the US and other large Western-Culture civilizations as oppressive ""Empires"" that are infringing on their god-given stake of the holy land. They want our troops out. And if that happened, they might feel appeased, but that opens the way for dictators and governments that the rest of the world believe should not exist. It's a circle of evil that cannot be stopped (except for maybe genocide, and that usually doesn't work out too well for anybody). It's the beliefs of our forefathers vs. the beliefs of their children.
In short, I just don't understand why one person would ever even consider hurting another person. I often get existential and ask myself what difference it makes when death and the unknown beyond is imminent anyway. The radical few for some reason need kill those of us that just want to be left alone. What's different about them that makes them feel justified in killing (even if they have a ""cause""), while I feel bad just stepping on a bug.
I hope that made sense. Did I mention I was drunk?

Now that you know how I think, I'll tell you my story.

I was born and raised in the most Mormon neighborhood you can imagine. My high-school was probably 90% Mormon and Mormon culture was all I ever knew. My mother and her entire family are as Mormon as you get and my father is also very Mormon (though a convert). My siblings all have their own problems, but remain mostly active anyway. Out of all of them, I'm the oddball; the problem child. My family loves me and I love them, but religion often gets in the way of this. I often feel like their love is conditional, while I try to love them unconditionally. (That reminds me: Get a dog. Might prevent suicide.)

I was the epitome of good mormon boys until my early teens and puberty. Because of the church and my parent's policy of complete abstinence of sex and even talking about it (except the single, half-assed warning my father gave me once that masturbating was evil, not that I knew what that was.), I gained some very incorrect beliefs about sex and morals in general. The first time I accidentally masturbated, I knew I was going to hell and physically and mentally punished myself about it by sleeping on the ground for weeks and mentally destroying what little self esteem I was developing. I never told anybody anything and prayed to god for repentance and wished that I could take it back. A few months later, a similar topic came up while I was talking with one of my older brothers and he actually let me know what was going on. I relaxed a bit and actually got comfortable enough that did it on purpose occasionally while still doing everything right (pretty dang common for even Mormon boys I'm guessing), though there was ""that seed of darkness"" planted in my mind because of my misunderstanding and unnatural sexual experiences. My mom also got me on some overly-intense SSRIs because I was a little depressed and questioning my beliefs when I was probably around 14 or 15. The side effects destroyed me. I never developed a normal sex drive, which has now lead to some unnatural fetishes and extreme social anxiety. I have never had a girlfriend and I don't think it's possible for me to ever have a wife and family, even though I think I would really like to.

Fast forward a couple of years until I'm 18, graduating seminary, attending temple/mission prep courses, and eager to go on a mission to experience another culture. In the back of my mind though, I realize that I've never really had a ""Spiritual Experience"", and I have many doubts and questions. I won't go into too much detail about those, but they were (and still are) your basic ones about polygamy, African Americans/Woman and the priesthood, why these things change if god is unchanging, etc, etc. How do people just have absolute faith about these things? The winners of wars write the history books, so I always take what I learn with a grain of salt unless I experience it for myself. I read the scriptures and book of mormon critically, and find a lot of it incredible, but a lot of it is also insane.
Everyone says that if you ask with enough faith for a spiritual experience, you will receive one... But the mind is a complex thing and if I ask with enough faith for a sandwich, my mind will make me think I got one. Perception is relative and makes up your own unique reality, and now I have a sandwich and you don't!

I knew that I wouldn't be going on a mission for myself, but for my parents. Plus there were still those misunderstandings and ""things"" that the church would be completely horrified of. I decide to start college before putting in my mission papers, just to prolong the decision, and my parents seemed ok with it. But when the semester ended and the reminders got more and more frequent, I completely lost it, packed up everything I owned, and move into a crummy 2 bedroom apartment in a bad part of town with 2 questionable acquaintances from high school. I had a temporary job that barely paid for my car expenses, rent, bills, and tuition... as long as I didn't eat and dug into my entire life's savings. My parents were kind enough to not cut me off completely even though they were devistated. They let me stay on their insurance so I could keep my meds and hopefully not get into too much trouble. By that time, I had probably been on every SSRI, SNRI, SSNRI, atypical antidepressant and antipsychotic known to man, plus several Benzodiazapines in order to keep me sane enough to stay in school even though in hindsight, they were doing more harm than good. By the way, despite all this crap, I found out that I'm sort of a genius and did amazingly well in school. As of writing this, I have several associates degrees, a (very close to) bachelors degree, a great GPA, fantastic references, and a promising future with likely any grad school I want.

Anyway, It was around that time when I moved out that I went completely insane, trying everything to figure out my identity. I tried being bi and gay (because of the meds and no libido, I had no interest in girls) with a lot of unmentionable things going on in that apartment (though I am proud to say that in the back of my mind, I couldn't shake 'the Straight' and so no ummm... penetration... ever happened... though everything else did. I'm doing pretty good at blocking out that year entirely from my mind). There was also rampant substance abuse. I mean everything. And a lot of it. I'm extremely lucky to be alive. There was a lot of random use of cigarettes, marijuana, Extacy, LSD, Meth, ketamine, perscription drugs, hard liquor, beer, and combinations of many of those (which often lead to the permiscuous behavior above). I never really liked alcohol or smoking, so I was the pill popper of our group, sometimes taking doses that would kill anybody with no tolerance and would cost several hundred dollars for one weekend. I slowly got more and more into debt, had to refinance my car, and eventually had a falling out with my roommates (one of which considered himself my 'boyfriend' even though the feeling was not mutual. I decided I wasn't gay right about when he decided he was). Throughout all of this, my parents never found out about any of it because I didn't talk to them that often. I was also never caught by the authorities amazingly, despite some drug deals going horribly wrong. I've been beat, had weapons pulled on me, and have lost thousands of dollars, but that was common where I was living and I couldn't stop. It would have probably been good for me to be caught, but I was able to stay in school and at least progress academically.

The only place for me to go when this was all over was back home to my amazing parents who took me back and never pressed too much about my time away. They just laid down the basic ground rules about no drugs and alcohol (they suspected some of that happened), the importance of staying in school (even though that has always been important to me), work and chores, etc. This was also about the time some of my high school friends were coming home from their missions, so I even started going to church when invited and paying tithing again.

That brings us to the present, several years later. I have seen the right doctors and am on the medication that is (mostly) right for me. I'm doing great in school. I have a great family and support system. My old life is practically gone and if you saw me, you wouldn't be able to tell I was ever anything but a good Mormon boy. I completely understand how lucky I am and how good I've got it, but every second I live is hell. Something is wrong in my brain. I understand the concepts of brain plasticity and who knows, I could probably recover. But it would take a drastic change. Drastic enough that I think it would be impossible.
Every time I join my parents for church and someone mentions an eternal family, I see my mom cringe. One of my older brothers had a baby recently and I know it kills my parents that I'm not going to be able to be part of the blessing. We have a stack of men's babtisms-for-the-dead-cards that need to be done that I can't do (and I think my mom isn't letting anyone else do them, just in case). Every once in a while somebody will sneakily say that it isn't too late for me to serve a mission or go on a date, but how can I preach something I don't believe, or mislead a girl into liking a scumbag.

I try not to get mad... I'm not against the church and am fine talking about it without getting defensive, but I'm feeling worse every day. I'm having more and more catatonic depressive days where nothing gets done. My anxiety is out of control whenever I do have to do something. I have frequent breakdowns, especially around finals. My ""friends"" from high school that went on missions don't understand and I haven't seen them in months. I don't really have friends anymore. The only thing I have going for me is my schooling and decent intelligence. If I could get a handle on things, I could make a difference in the world and do some great things, but I dont... I've recently turned back to some of the drugs after a year or so of being clean (with no help). They're the only things that make me feel like I'm worth anything. I know it may be a paradox that it's because of drugs that I feel worthless in the first place, but I would rather have some great highs and terrible lows than a constant low.

I have to get out of here. I need to leave these circumstances. I have at least a year of school left so I can't follow up on what would be my optimal choice and go far, far away to graduate school. But I believe I would fail at that anyway because of my mental health and drug issues. I just finished up the temp job thats been funding everything for the last 3 years, so now, I am completely reliant on my family for everything. The only way to leave is to leave for good and hope that what's after this life is better. I have all the drugs I need to make it pleasant, and I know enough about them to make sure it works. Enough beer, Vodka, xanax, and Klonopin is enough for Allosteric Modification of GABA-A Receptors to allow the Medulla to shut down, and maybe I'd get some E and Ice to make it fun. I wouldn't do it to make anybody sad or to show them how much they miss me. I am just sick of being miserable every day. And if your response to that is to just ""change your attitude!"", or ""force yourself to laugh!"", then just shut the fuck up. If ""it always gets better"", then why has it always gotten worse. I may look ok on the outside, but I'm broken beyond repair on the inside.

I've been to enough counselors and therapists to know that an internet message board isn't going to help, so I probably won't be back to check this. It's a throw away account anyway with a password that I already forgot. I'll admit I'm pretty wimpy and probably won't do anything rash right away, hell I'll probably never really commit suicide, but I wouldn't be that disappointed if I accidentally OD'd on something. I just felt closer to it tonight than ever and wanted to write down why.

I just like, need another beer (That Apple Red stuff... Delicious), a dog, and a basement apartment with a backyard. Then suicide wouldn't seem better than life. Did I mention I'm drunk? on beer?

If there is a god and an afterlife, I hope I'm judged based on intentions and values rather than circumstances and actions.

70052,"The Chronicles of Sav- Titty Pics Rock Hello, welcome to the Chronicles of Sav, and today I want to share my experience of how I got my first titty pics. So, it started on a cool Thursday evening where I was playing some Among Us. Y’know everything was going good and one of the friends I was playing with was simping over one of the other players.

It makes a lot of sense.  I have about 500 idea's an hour and my brain is always racing. However when you have all these idea's you have negative ones. The negitive ones are more frequent.

263854,"Could use support to get through next few daysJust a brief summary of my story:

\- Longstanding (20 years +) severe depression and anxiety (plus OCD, panic disorder)

\- Been on a lot of medications. A couple worked at first then didn't. No commonly prescribed antidepressants do a thing now.

\- Been in psych hospitals 3 times (voluntary). Kept me safe I suppose. Not much else. 

\- Had ECT (didn't help depression just screwed up my memory. About 20 sessions total).

\- Started Ketamine therapy. It's the only thing that has worked for me. Miraculous results, until recently when for some reason it doesn't seem to be doing much.

\- Had lots and lots of therapy over 20 years. Don't feel that it has made much of a difference. 

\- Good job, good money, great wife - when I'm not depressed I love the life set up I have.

\- Drink very very little and have pretty much stopped that. Take meds only as prescribed. 

\- No past significant trauma. My depression is definitely endogenous. While certainly environment, stress, etc can be triggers, there are countless times that things have been going great, just coasting along and then one morning I'll wake up in a shocking state. 

Anyway I won't say I've tried EVERYTHING but it's reasonable to say that I have tried a lot. I don't feel there are many options left. Ketamine was fantastic and I hope it will work again but just recently it hasn't helped.

I'm in a foreign country at the moment. The only people I know here are the work colleagues in the office. They're nice but they talk about where to go to eat, football, etc. You know, normal things. I feel so bad that the only thing I seem capable of talking about is just how horrendous this is. 

I'm in a bad, bad way. Acute severe depression and anxiety. I have another few days to go through which should be nothing but it seems impossible. Been thinking a lot about ending it. I guess I'd just really appreciate a bit of support to get me through the next few days after which I'll fly home to my wife. Don't get me wrong, I'll still feel awful then but at least I'll have someone I love and can talk to about all this.

Thanks so much, sorry it was so long. First post so wanted to give a decent amount of information.

(depressed/suicidal folks) have anexity problems...or just seem to be down on their luck with making friends...or maybe their in a new situation and are just having a rough go with it....

so my idea is this:
(I don't know how this will be received I'm just suggesting)
What if we had like a friend4friend program or subreddit...or on this subreddit...
where people who are depressed can find other people to talk to via skype, or msn to keep them minimal company. 
I mean I know there are other ways to find people to chat...but what I'm saying is a way to find people who are also depressed (because they can understand or they don't mind if you are) or just people who don't mind talking to someone that is depressed.
Like people can unite in their rough times.

I don't know..I'm just personally having a really rough go at it...and it's just hard pretending that I'm happy all the time, you know? I'd love it if I could just hang with someone that would be ok with me being sad...and we could share stories and cheer each other up...

Would anyone be interested in this?
I'm sorry if it's a bad idea...or if this is the wrong place to post this...

EDIT: Well for now...um if you'd like to talk to me! Please go ahead and send me your MSN or Skype. Maybe I can work out some sort of chat room? Maybe I can pair people up? (I wouldn't mind that) Or we can just post s4df=searching for depression friend on our own. OR!! You can just post your addies here! Let me know what you think would work!

EDIT 2: Also maybe we can team up with /r/depression

EDIT 3: So I think we should just try to work this into /r/suicidewatch and /r/depression and if there is a problem I'll make a subreddit. So I guess the terms we could use would be **s4lmc= searching for like minded companion**. We'll assume it's mostly online unless the person says otherwise.

All I ask is you guys pro-trump or pro-Biden go on incognito mode and search what has trump done in his 4 years and what has Biden done as VP what do they want to do in their next terms and what are some policies they implemented and wanna further implement.

I know a lot of you think Trump is a racist bigoted xenophobic moron but I still want you to search it up. Don't watch mocking videos cause there are tones of them on both sides and they serve no purpose on educating you. Don't look up bad things first look up good things.

I am well aware that the election is over and this post will not affect it. But I believe everyone should educate themselves on people they support. Both trump and Biden have done some questionable things in the past but it's the future that matters.

Even after educating yourself if you choose a side that's ok. I got nothing against you. But first learn about the people you are behind. You'd be shocked on what you learn about the other candidate.

\*One last thing for those who really don't care and would insta downvote this for even mentioning something neutral about trump. The reason you probably hate trump(and this doesn't apply to a lot of you) is because the media has portrayed him as such. You have to understand that before he was the president he was a very rich person being the president only made him stronger and he had a lot of dust on a lot of people obvs the higher ranking guys would wanna get him out of power. So even tho this paragraph seems like I'm taking his side. This is just an incentive for you to go and research, atleast that way when someone cross questions you you'd be ready.

I wouldn't know how to navigate the bank, how to pay bills, how to secure an apartment, how to get a job, any of that. I wouldn't know the stuff that's expected for people to suddenly know the day they turn 18. Why don't schools teach you how to live in modern society? Why are they still afraid of change? What's stopping schools from replacing courses like ""ancient history"" with courses like ""how to not just live on ramen for the first decade of your adulthood""? Please! Teach us things we need to know instead of wasting our time and giving us terrible memories of childhood! 

My childhood has been useless. The only things I've learned that I cherish and use (Morse code, Early Modern English, crochet, various political tidbits) have been from Youtube videos. They've all been things that I did *in spite* of school, not assisted by it. School gives people mild trauma (all the adults I know, even my 40-year-old parents) still have nightmares about not turning in papers on time or not getting enough credits to graduate. 

Dear schools; please stop teaching us useless information. Also, please stop trying to suppress our instinct to socialize; it's very necessary to our development and studies have shown that it's damaging to students' mental health to teach them that socializing is wrong.

They both used to talk to me every day and then they started going out Christmas time and spoke to me a few times a week outside of school. They had huge arguments and broke up about 10 times in 3 months and I always mediated and got them talking.

Then lockdown started, I'll speak to one of them twice a month for about a half hour convo then they'll just not respond, idk whether it's because I'm annoying or they've just got stuff going on. Plus they'll only ever respond if it's about them or their SO.Which is annoying

The other will take 3 or 4 days to reply and then take another day to respond. I've got these people through so much, listened and supported them and then they just ignore me for sometimes weeks on end. They both have problems in their lives so I don't want to push it and ask just to find out they're nursing injuries from parents and seem evil.

I'm a bit of a loner anyway but I'll see them post videos with each other or their other friends (I'm still shielding) and then I'll feel really inadequate, idk I just feel really bad. One every so often says they miss me and takes a week to reply with a ""lol"".

I hope I am never stupid enough to use addictive substances like coke. 

Also, 23 days sober. But I don’t feel like alcohol is that big of a deal as long as it’s only occasional. And not getting black out drunk (which I have never done). Just something to make everything a bit sweeter.

It’s easy to get discouraged if you’re not good at something, but try to keep going just for the fun of it. Make that ugly plushy, draw unrealistically, start a wobbly crochet blanket!

Also: Hobbies aren’t gendered! So many creative, relaxing hobbies are “deemed girly”. Many of them are awesome basic skills to have, like sewing to repair clothes, growing your own food, or learning to cook meals! Boys, you aren’t limited to MEAT and SPORTS and CODE. And vice versa!

I also have Crohn's disease which I was diagnosed with at age 7. My mother worked multiple jobs to afford my health care but always blamed her lack of free time and money on me. 
My mother holds onto a lot of pain and stress and also used to beat me. 
And my grandfather who also was a very angry person beat me.

I've had over 75 partners I've tried to use as a crutch. 
I came out as bisexual recently. 
And I'm 26 and still haven't finished my bachelors degree. 
I'm visiting my family for spring break and I got really depressed. Seeing my family is so hard because I can't help thinking that they all think I'm a piece of shit who will never get things right. 
Even though I'm the only person in my family to attempt a higher education I still feel like I'm a subhuman. I shouldn't have lived through the medical intensity. I should give up.

329405,"I’ve decided in two years, if I can’t change my life I’m biting the bullet.I’ve been depressed since I was a child. I’ve been suicidal since I was a teenager. I’ve been extremely depressed since I was about 18. 

It’s been a long time coming but I’ve finally decided that in two years time, if things don’t work out or get any better, it’s time to leave this party. I’ll play a nice record, pull a few from a handle of good whiskey, and send a few friends the address for the cops. 

I want to make it clear I’m not advocating suicide. Suicide is an option, but it’s the Taco Bell of life decisions, there’s a lot of other options before you go “fuck it, Taco Bell”. The best options take the most work, but they’re worth it when you can sit back and enjoy something you made yourself. 

The truth is, I don’t want to die. I like being in a world where new things happen and I can enjoy those things... but that glitter has faded for me. I don’t want to die, but I’m tired of being alive. I’m tired of being at this party and watching people have fun while all I want to do is grab my coat and leave. 

My friends I’ve confided in tell me they wouldn’t respect me if I ended up doing it. That it would hurt them, and they’d feel responsible. I can’t live my life for other people, and I can’t continue to suffer for them either. I owe myself some peace. 

That’s why I’m giving myself two years. Two years to make major life changing decisions, to put effort into all the hobbies and dreams I have to see what floats. Two years to move across the country, meet new people, maybe have better romances. Two years for my brain to age, my body to mature, and myself to grow a little wiser. 

At the end of that I’ll be in my mid-twenties, the prime time of my life. I’ll have struggled with depression, self-hatred, dysmorphia, anxiety, and abuse, for literally two decades of my existence. If it doesn’t change I’m not going to waste away becoming more bitter and misanthropic as the years go on, I can’t. I’ve been on medications, I’ve gone to therapy. 

I’m not going to waste my time at a party I don’t want to be at, but I’m going to try and make it a little more entertaining while I’m here and see how I feel about sticking around in an hour or two.

60201,"venting/saying whats on my mind (kind of a hot mess) this post is gonna be all over the place and probably really hard to read since im kind of tired rn but oh well. do what you want with your replies (i.e. give advice, relate, give criticism, joke around, etc i dont really care unless youre being a jerk)

my school is so proud of itself and thinks its super progressive and ""high class"" yet a new student catches the virus basically every week and everyone is crammed probably not following social distancing (idk, i chose to go online). the teachers treat online school like irl school which is extremely inappropriate given online learning, in nature, is a whole other realm from real life school. my grades have plummetted and i honestly dont think i can get into even at least a mid-tier college given the downward spiral my grades have taken. my dream college is very selective and 99% of their emphasis is on class rank. i thought i had a chance if i had good grades, a great sat, and amazing essays since its virtually impossible to land in the top 10% at my school unless youve made straight A+s for every single class youve ever taken (my school is very asian, and thats coming from an asian person myself, and the competition is insane. there are people who have literally taken their own lives because of how bad the competition at my school is, but theyve just brushed it under the rug and are pretending like they care about our mental health). i dont think the college is going to be very sympathetic to those whose grades have slipped during quarantine, theyre very straightforward and dont really care if youve had a struggle or anything, they just care about rank.

~~probably gonna be posting here a lot more ever since i got banned from the discord (the mod was in a very bad mood and decided to take it out on me, everyone ive talked to agrees it was an unreasonable ban but they refuse to accept my appeal for some reason)~~

anyway, quarantine is making my life miserable. the only social interaction i get is on discord from a bunch of simps who i dont even like being around, my real friends are all online but i havent been able to play any games with them lately due to time conflicts. everybody at school hates me because theyve automatically labelled me as a thot for some reason (never even kissed someone before, so i just assume theyre jealous). my parents are great but i cant really play video games with them or talk about gen z stuff since theyre boomers (i love you mom and dad **🥺** ). my brother has moved out a very long time ago and hes been real busy lately, so i cant rlly hang out with him either (though he is coming over next week with his new puppy, so thats something to look forward to)

also for some odd reason ive noticed the more negativity i receive the more self absorbed i get. the other day this girl in a discord server saying i was stuck up after calling myself cute in a selfie and for some odd reason it just boosted my ego even more, i guess its because she came off as really jealous.

finding a significant other in 2020 as a teen has become so freaking hard. all of the guys at my school are just not my type at all. theyre sexist, racist, homophobic, etc. it frustrates me how they use homosexuality as an insult (i.e. ""thats so gay""), say the N word openly, call people the F slur, etc. and what pisses me even worse is when a dude keeps insinuating that he'd like me better as an ""uwu girl"" and that im too much of a ""bruh girl"". theyre so over their heads too. i told a dude i met in one of my zoom classes that i found his personality very attractive and he took that as me confessing my love to him and started calling himself my boyfriend. i ended up telling him i wasnt interested, and now he just stalks all of my social medias and keeps trying to contact me. i block him and he just makes a new account, its literally so pathetic and i honestly plan to cuss him out next time he does it.

im bad at ending posts especially messy rants/vents like these, so yeah... thanks for reading if youve made it this far! oh and btw this is so random but i hate how people, including teens, just assume that every teen has vaped/smoked weed before. i, personally, would not vape or do drugs but i dont care if my friends do it as long as they dont try to make me do it.",non-suicide,"venting/saying whats on my mind (kind of a hot mess) this post is gonna be all over the place and probably really hard to read since im kind of tired rn but oh well. do what you want with your replies (i.e. give advice, relate, give criticism, joke around, etc i dont really care unless youre being a jerk) my school is so proud of itself and thinks its super progressive and ""high class"" yet a new student catches the virus basically every week and everyone is crammed probably not following social distancing (idk, i chose to go online). the teachers treat online school like irl school which is extremely inappropriate given online learning, in nature, is a whole other realm from real life school. my grades have plummetted and i honestly dont think i can get into even at least a mid-tier college given the downward spiral my grades have taken. my dream college is very selective and 99% of their emphasis is on class rank. i thought i had a chance if i had good grades, a great sat, and amazing essays since its virtually impossible to land in the top 10% at my school unless youve made straight A+s for every single class youve ever taken (my school is very asian, and thats coming from an asian person myself, and the competition is insane. there are people who have literally taken their own lives because of how bad the competition at my school is, but theyve just brushed it under the rug and are pretending like they care about our mental health). i dont think the college is going to be very sympathetic to those whose grades have slipped during quarantine, theyre very straightforward and dont really care if youve had a struggle or anything, they just care about rank. probably gonna be posting here a lot more ever since i got banned from the discord (the mod was in a very bad mood and decided to take it out on me, everyone ive talked to agrees it was an unreasonable ban but they refuse to accept my appeal for some reason) anyway, quarantine is making my life miserable. the only social interaction i get is on discord from a bunch of simps who i dont even like being around, my real friends are all online but i havent been able to play any games with them lately due to time conflicts. everybody at school hates me because theyve automatically labelled me as a thot for some reason (never even kissed someone before, so i just assume theyre jealous). my parents are great but i cant really play video games with them or talk about gen z stuff since theyre boomers (i love you mom and dad **:pleading_face:** ). my brother has moved out a very long time ago and hes been real busy lately, so i cant rlly hang out with him either (though he is coming over next week with his new puppy, so thats something to look forward to) also for some odd reason ive noticed the more negativity i receive the more self absorbed i get. the other day this girl in a discord server saying i was stuck up after calling myself cute in a selfie and for some odd reason it just boosted my ego even more, i guess its because she came off as really jealous. finding a significant other in 2020 as a teen has become so freaking hard. all of the guys at my school are just not my type at all. theyre sexist, racist, homophobic, etc. it frustrates me how they use homosexuality as an insult (i.e. ""thats so gay""), say the N word openly, call people the F slur, etc. and what pisses me even worse is when a dude keeps insinuating that he'd like me better as an ""uwu girl"" and that im too much of a ""bruh girl"". theyre so over their heads too. i told a dude i met in one of my zoom classes that i found his personality very attractive and he took that as me confessing my love to him and started calling himself my boyfriend. i ended up telling him i wasnt interested, and now he just stalks all of my social medias and keeps trying to contact me. i block him and he just makes a new account, its literally so pathetic and i honestly plan to cuss him out next time he does it. im bad at ending posts especially messy rants/vents like these, so yeah... thanks for reading if youve made it this far! oh and btw this is so random but i hate how people, including teens, just assume that every teen has vaped/smoked weed before. i, personally, would not vape or do drugs but i dont care if my friends do it as long as they dont try to make me do it.",non-suicide,0.70908064,0.40637645,0.38043195,0.63924503,0.55718005

110139,"Here's a story I wrote in 8th grade about Bob the Builder and Fortnite Bob the Builder sat on his metal toilet that he stole from the homeless shelter.

""I need a new medium for construction."" He said discreetly to himself. 

""Oh I know!"" He yelled. The rumble of his manly voice shook the walls of his wooden shack that he stole from the backyard of the homeless shelter.

""I can build stuff in Fortnite battle royale!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Bob the Builder shouted. His voice was soon drowned out by the sound of him farting excessively from the constipation he got after eating that doughnut he picked out of the dumpster from the homeless shelter. 

Bob the Builder walked out of his wooden shack and walked down the streets of the city. He walked over to the Fatman Homeless Center and pushed through the glass doors. He walked up to a random homeless guy who was sitting at a table and poking a live squirrel with his pencil. 

""Excuse me, ma'am? CAN I BORRRRROWWW DAT SQUIRRRLLLL DAT YOU HAAFF???"" Bob the Builder yelled violently. He had to be direct if he wanted to intimidate the homeless guy, who was very muscular as a result of all his bank robberies. 

""YESSSS DUUUUUDEEE!"" The homeless guy cried. He began shaking violently and fell out of his plastic folding chair. 

""Thank you ma'am"" Bob said casually. 

Bob grabbed the squirrel and ran across the street to the Apple store. He ran up to the clerk and yelled savagely at him. 

""GIVE ME APPLE PRODUCT TO PLAY FORTNITE ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" He shouted while shaking the squirrel in the clerk's face. 

""OH! Mommy save me!!!!!"" He whimpered. He pulled a big, red apple out of the trash can and tried to hand it to Bob.

Instead, the squirrel bit the apple with his strangely large mouth and started shaking the apple around. 

""NO! BAD SQUIRREL!"" Ranted Bob. He took the apple from the mouth of the squirrel and smashed the squirrel's head on the counter of the Apple store. The squirrel was unscathed, and he ripped off the fur on his chest to reveal a Superman outfit. 

""NO! IT'S SQUIRRELMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Screamed Bob. He pulled out his chainsaw and began trying to slice the squirrel in half. The squirrel used his laser vision and melted through the chainsaw.

Squirrelman then fired his laser vision at Bob's head. Luckily for Bob, his forehead had been buttered so much and was so shiny that the laser vision bounced off and hit Squirrelman in the face. Squirrelman suddenly began squeaking and blew up in a puff of feathers.

""FATALITY"" Said the announcer in the sky, who sounded an awful lot like the guy from Mortal Kombat. 

Bob went back to his shack with his big red apple. He pulled his pants down and sat on the toilet, since it was the only piece of furniture he had. Naturally, he began farting excessively. His farts were so powerful that the air made the toilet water splash onto Bob's butt. Bob was shaking the apple in his hands, yelling at it to try and figure out how to play Fortnite with it. He shook it so much that he dropped it between his legs, and it fell into the toilet. Bob stood up in a panic. Should he reach in with his hand to get his apple back? No, that was unsanitary! He had to do something that wouldn't get him dirty. Then he remembered how Squirrelman's laser vision bounced off Bob's shiny forehead. Maybe the same thing would work with the toilet?

I'll never get employment"" It's pretty narcissistic. Honestly the only non narcissistic part about the whole situation is the fact that I'm not doing it because only for the sake of certain people around me (my dad- my friend whose cousin just did it- my mom grandma etc). But then I end up resenting them for keeping me in this pain- but thats once again thinking about MY pain. I'm just curious what people on here think about the link between suicide as like a negative type of narcissism. Were not focused on hobbies, other people, causes? Those thoughts are 100% ME focused usually? I don't know where to go from here but I'm hoping someone will have another eye opening point to add that will help the pain go away. I want to be a good person- I don't want to always think about myself. How can I contribute to others and make them happier?

133208,"I don't want to live as an inferior human anymore.Hey guys and gals, I really need a place to get this off my chest so here it goes:

Im currently 23, turning 24 in January. This summer I was bed bound for the whole of the summer due to brain injury.
This accident happened, as I was getting my life back on track. Giving it all at uni, doing sports as much as my knees allowed me to, and trying to get to know more people.
All of this was an effort, to change my life from being a hermit with poor social skills and low ambitions. I spend my years at uni getting fat and hiding from other people and work. 
Although I got rid of the fat now, I still have strech marks all over the place. This and my not-as-good-as-it-used-to-be physique due knee problems, which won't fucking go away, add to my inferiority complex. 
I feel I have failed life to the core, wasted on of the most important years in the life of a succesful human being, and the milestones I missed I cannot do over. Even if I try to turn it around again, which I was semi succesful the last year before my accident, it just seems to me, that this mistakes will stain my very being forever.  I can be better than now in the future, but the fucking past cannot change, and that is what makes me want to kill myself so so bad. I really think I cannot get as far in life as I could have, because of the lower brain processing power as I got older now(I get a lot of shit for saying this at home, but I really think this is true). This mistakes aren't even reversible, like my stretchmarks, I would have to live with their consequences all my life long, maybe getting equal in (relative, as I cannot undo my isolation) experience with my peers in the thirties, but that wouldn't matter, because I cannot be happy there if I wasn't happy in my early 20s right?

I still try to change at the moment, as im recovering, because I have to choices, giving it all or killing myself.

90056,"It's long but short if you know what I mean.You see my parents didn't really give a fuck

They use to physically fight all the time, well that's just my luck

Well that's what I get for being born with a silver spoon

That's most of my memory from my childhood

I remember a lot of the fights and the reasons why

And man, the amount of problems they had I ain't gonna lie

I could write a whole fucking list and it wouldn't fit

They say ignorance is bliss so that's why I always get fuckin lit

Not many really knew until recently

Because it's really fucked me up, I live in misery

But it helps me reflect on the person I am

So I can understand others who have also been dealt with a 
shitty hand

Back in school I use to get bullied a lot

It seems everywhere I'd go I got hated on

I was a quiet and shy kid so i got chastisized

And I'll tell you now, suicide was something as a kid that I'd fantasized

I got into trouble a lot even though things were never really my fault

I learned early on that no one will listen even when i told

them the truth because to some they just don't really care

They just wanna let you know their own version of fair

A lot of this stems from my mum n dad

I try to hold a lot of this anomosity within because I know they also had it bad

They remind me n my siblings constantly

Beating us then telling us we had it better than them like honestly

What kinda logic is that? Man it's fuckin whack

I still got scars on my face, hey mum thanks for that

And btw thanks for the name

I spent my entire life even now getting mocked the same

Of course now i get it a lot less

because now I'll fuck with u if u wanna test

One of the things they argued about was that my dad gambled a lot

And another is the fact that my mum donated to her cult like religion and didn't stop

Like really, I'm not even going to get into the list

I just stated these 2 things because I believe they both needed this

Everyone has their own vices and their own escapes

I'm willing to look the other way and let them enjoy their cakes

But if you flip the cards around, Uno they'll reverse it back on to me

Yeah, I'm talking about if they ever found out the shit I did to 
keep my own mind company

But fuck it since this rap is dark anyway

My mum pulled a butcher knife on me since i had somethin to say

She use to grab whatever she could find

Beat me up and then tell me I should be glad that she was kind

How her dad use to beat them up even more

Like really who the fuck is even keeping score?

Left a scar on the bridge of my nose from punching my glasses into my face

Then went back to tell my dad that I hit her, man this bitch has no shame

Every time I'd get sick and if you know me you'll know that I'm weak

She will scold me non stop and then tell me that she cares for me

She will guilt me and shame me as if I did something wrong

I'm literally scared to cough around her and this shit goes on and on

Even to this day, anything that happens to me

I refuse to tell them anything, because they twist it immediately

I am always the bad guy in their eyes

My own dad told me I'm the number 2 reason he hates his life

My mum constantly tells me when I die I'm going straight to hell

What am I to them I can't really tell

I'll be lying if i told you back then I didn't wish them both to be dead

But now that I'm older I just wish my own life to end

I know exactly the way I will do it so I'm taking my time

That's a lie, if you have severe depression you'll know it's a matter of your own damn mind

I refuse to go therapy because I'll never trust them

If you wondering why, I can't even trust my own parents

They've lied to me countless times

They've made up stories of me and told the family lies

They will hear my side and ignore everything I say

Then they will make up their own worst version and call it a day

Just another day of our son being an absolute useless lazy cunt

Even though I've literally been breaking my back but their care is none

I really can go on and on since this is a constant fight

Honestly... this is a tunnel where I don't see a light

I was planning on offing myself on my 31st

But I didn't end up going through with it, it would've been the worst

I guess I'm still too weak to even make the leap

No I'm not talking about jumping from a thousand feet

I know the best way to finish the job

After all these years, you really think i wouldn't have figured my own send off?

I don't even know why I bother writing all of this

I guess it helps keep my mind off of thinking worser things

I stopped the weed just to keep my damn head straight

Even though the reason was to keep it from doing so in the first place

But I can't let it consume me because I can't

See myself become an addict since that's a trap

Every time I write here I feel like such a sook

I actually have almost 0 self esteem even though now i got the looks

Now i got the attitude and I got the confidence

At least on the outside I can make it seem more prominent

Cuz on the inside I'm fucking dead as hell

I've gone through so many bad break ups and had so many friendships that fell

You might think these things aren't that big a deal

Every one goes through the same, come on let's be real

Well if you actually been through some real shit too

Then you'll be more understanding of the shit that I been through

I've noticed a lot of people who haven't been through much

Are quick to disregard, they're basically in a sense out of touch

But like I say ignorance is bliss so actually I am envious

Of all your happy families, I hate coping with this

Maybe in my next life I can feel the same

Then I can also turn my back and say that this shit's lame

I've had so many people try and downplay the shit I tell them

Even though I downplay most of the shit that I felt then

So this is why I try to keep shit to myself

Hearing others question me when I'm opening myself is really not good for my health

So this is why I write here when I'm sad

So I don't have to hear people telling me that I ain't really got it that bad

Fuck all of you who doubted me

Although I know it's because you were born from a different tree

It's getting late now and I can't sleep

Maybe it'll be easier 6 feet deep",suicide,"It's long but short if you know what I mean.You see my parents didn't really give a fuck They use to physically fight all the time, well that's just my luck Well that's what I get for being born with a silver spoon That's most of my memory from my childhood I remember a lot of the fights and the reasons why And man, the amount of problems they had I ain't gonna lie I could write a whole fucking list and it wouldn't fit They say ignorance is bliss so that's why I always get fuckin lit Not many really knew until recently Because it's really fucked me up, I live in misery But it helps me reflect on the person I am So I can understand others who have also been dealt with a shitty hand Back in school I use to get bullied a lot It seems everywhere I'd go I got hated on I was a quiet and shy kid so i got chastisized And I'll tell you now, suicide was something as a kid that I'd fantasized I got into trouble a lot even though things were never really my fault I learned early on that no one will listen even when i told them the truth because to some they just don't really care They just wanna let you know their own version of fair A lot of this stems from my mum n dad I try to hold a lot of this anomosity within because I know they also had it bad They remind me n my siblings constantly Beating us then telling us we had it better than them like honestly What kinda logic is that?

71936,"Starting to acknowledge this about myselfI've been considering suicide every day for the past few weeks. It comes as a bright, strong flash that lasts about 45 minutes. Though for most of my day, I'm relatively even keeled. I'm functional at work. I don't think anyone knows this is happening below the surface. 

I'm 36. I'm doing pretty well in my career. I make 100k+. I work out. I'm tall and reasonably attractive. I have a few close friends.

What's driving me down is a sense of hopelessness with respect to romance. I've been on nearly 40 dates this year, perhaps 70 total in the last 2 years. Not a single one has led to anything. I can recognize the moment in a date when she's not interested. I've memorized all of the polite excuses girls use. Sometimes they're not so polite and they'll say things like ""I'm sorry I have such high standards."" 

This is not new. I've been single for most of my life. I feel miserable and unlovable. I always thought I was going to have a family when I became an adult. I was single in HS. A scant few relationships in college. And my adulthood has mostly been alone. I've never had a relationship last longer than 3 months. 

I don't know what's wrong with me. No one will tell me. I feel like I'm living out groundhog day. The same thing keeps happening to me over and over. The rejection is having a cumulative effect on me. I feel worthless. I dread the idea that this is my life. That I toil in the gym and at work and come home to an empty apartment. That I sit alone on weekend nights, after spending the previous days asking if anyone wants to do anything. 

I just don't give a shit any more. I meditate, I go to the gym. I eat well. I do all the things one is supposed to do to ward off depression and sadness. And yet, I have this deep aching in my chest. I feel like I've lived my life behind plate glass. I watch everyone else move on with their life, fall in love, travel together, eat out together and create their own families. 

For the past 9 months, I've been aggressively changing things in my life. I've started going to the gym 4-5x a week. I started meditating again. I've gone out and got a new job that pays 20% more. I've taken dance classes, improv classes. 

Nothing seems to make a difference. I'm still alone. I still get the ""didn't feel the spark"" notes back from girls after a date. Though most of the time I get nothing, but it's enough see the subtle panic in their eyes an hour into the date, furtive glances from left to right as they struggle to come up with a plausible excuse to leave the date early. If I do make it past the first date, I'll usually get another excuse. They suddenly don't feel well or a relative died. I wish I was exaggerating. 

Even seeing this, I feel pathetic that I've let something like this 'get to me.' I don't know why I place such a premium on having a relationship. The few times in my life when I have been with someone, it felt amazing. I felt like a whole person. Whereas now, everything feels like a waste of time. I feel like I'm walking through life with a kickme sign on my back with out knowing it. 

Suicide for me now, is just like ""get me off this ride, I don't like this."" There's nothing dramatic about it. I'm just done, I want out. I don't care anymore. Fuck it. I've had a pretty decent life so far. I don't feel sad. I feel terrified that my life won't improve. That I'll be stuck, that the next 5 years of my life will look like the last 15 years of my life. Nothing changes for me. It doesn't seem to get better. 


 

",suicide,"Starting to acknowledge this about myself. I've been considering suicide every day for the past few weeks. It comes as a bright, strong flash that lasts about 45 minutes. Though for most of my day, I'm relatively even keeled. I'm functional at work. I don't think anyone knows this is happening below the surface. I'm 36. I'm doing pretty well in my career. I make 100k+. I work out. I'm tall and reasonably attractive. I have a few close friends. What's driving me down is a sense of hopelessness with respect to romance. I've been on nearly 40 dates this year, perhaps 70 total in the last 2 years. Not a single one has led to anything. I can recognize the moment in a date when she's not interested. I've memorized all of the polite excuses girls use. Sometimes they're not so polite and they'll say things like ""I'm sorry I have such high standards."" This is not new. I've been single for most of my life. I feel miserable and unlovable. I always thought I was going to have a family when I became an adult. I was single in HS. A scant few relationships in college. And my adulthood has mostly been alone. I've never had a relationship last longer than 3 months. I don't know what's wrong with me. No one will tell me. I feel like I'm living out groundhog day. The same thing keeps happening to me over and over. The rejection is having a cumulative effect on me. I feel worthless. I dread the idea that this is my life. That I toil in the gym and at work and come home to an empty apartment. That I sit alone on weekend nights, after spending the previous days asking if anyone wants to do anything. I just don't give a shit any more. I meditate, I go to the gym. I eat well. I do all the things one is supposed to do to ward off depression and sadness. And yet, I have this deep aching in my chest.

This is genuinely my opinion and the reason this is a hive mind opinion is because a lot of people feel the same way about this app. Now I'm sorry if this sounded harsh but I just needed to get it off my chest.",non-suicide,0.5426554,0.8505644,0.2133834,0.55615485,0.22648737
294616,"People want to BE me.Hi. I am a 15 year old boy who is a freshman in high school who can't sleep. The time is 2:04 AM.

I don't know what's wring with me. I know others think they're lost, but I know exactly what is wrong with me but I can't do anything about it. I go to counseling. I lie to my counsellors that my home life is fine, nothing's been up with my mom. Communications have been fine, when yesterday she was yelling at me for crying. Apparently out of no reason. I was crying because of this. I keep thinking about it.

I attempted suicide on July 25, 2010. It seems so distant now, even though it's been four and a half years since then. Since then I keep thinking to myself ""Do it. Why don't you?"" Like the crazy fuck I am. I have every means to do it. Car keys I can nick from my parents, I have a fucking bow and arrow in my room I can use to puncture my skull with.

But at school. I am literally everyone's friend. People look up to me. I get a lot of attention from grills. I have plenty of people to hang out with. Popular kids, nerdy kids, socially inept kids, the anime kids, the stereotypical high school non popular girl group, hot girls, everyone.

This past Christmas my former bully reached out to me and asked if we could ""start on a clean slate"" since ""he's changed"". This is the one sole person who crippled me today. I told him that I believe he's changed as much as I believe the moon landing was faked.

My counsellors told me that I may have clinical depression. No shit, I think. I'm also suicidal. But what nobody knows is that I'm a psychopath. I have complete means to go around and manipulate and lie so well you won't know I did. This helped me a lot when I got in trouble.

This also made me think that my mindset is set on seeing others as potential benefits. Not equals. Benefits.

So I've been thinking. I have a friend I want to discuss with my problems. The only person I trust, her name is Shelly(Not really she hates people rhyming her own name) and she may or may not hate me. So I don't know whether I should talk to her, and I value our friendship.

I have extreme social anxiety, +anxiety in general and topped off with depression. Nothing special in my case.
This year I started in a new school and I tried to just be a normal student, but inevitably I ended up eating every lunch in the school's psychologist office (just like my old school). She's been very nice and understanding, and I've opened up a lot to her.
I always tried to miss school, be absent, I would feel awful in the mornings not wanting to go. What's the point if literally no one is waiting for me. Not even the teachers would notice my absence. But as time went on I would then be backtracked in owed work, which would overwhelm me and make me worse.
Fast forward now, we're all stuck at home, what I wanted right. I have spiraled so much into myself I don't know what to do. Being alone at these times isn't helping me at all, at least at school I could see different faces, I wouldn't talk but there would be moments I enjoyed being there for.
Being depressed is nothing new, I would frequently go into the psychologist's office to cry and not understand why I was so depressed.
I don't live with my parents as they're in another country, I live with a family friend.
I'm way overdue in a bunch of online work, im on the borderline of failing, school ends in June.
I don't know what to do, whenever I try to do work I get headaches and want to cry, I never get anything done. I've sent countless apology emails to my teachers which makes me feel worse and I have been sending some emails to the psychologist. She's been trying to keep me hopeful I guess but I don't feel joy in anything. I loved to draw but I've completely stopped. I don't see myself doing anything else. She tried to convince me today after I sent her a hopeless email yesterday, that I should try to think about graduating and it's only a couple of weeks left. But that doesn't give me motivation at all, so what if I don't graduate. I feel endlessly hopeless.
I was on the border of taking my life some weeks ago with some 'anxiety' medication but an aunt I was visiting thought I was trying to get addicted and took the bottle away from me (after I woke up at 3:30pm that day)
Point being, I've been very close in doing it
I'm sorry I'm rambling
I don't think the psychologist thinks I'd seriously do something like that, even though I've told her before I just wish I would get in the way of a car on my way home.
I was wondering
If I tell her how seriously I've been thinking suicidal thoughts, what would she do
Would she try sending me to a crisis center? (Or something like that)
I don't want to be depressed anymore
I don't want this
But I don't want to risk myself by being sent to a crisis center with this pandemic going around

And also it can be so scary to a point where I feel like I can't take it anymore and reality starts feeling sort of slippery. I have stopped caring what the people that I assume care for me would think if I were to die earlier. I try to care about them back, and I don't want them to suffer, I don't want to hurt them, I would even protect them from harm(I don't think I show it however). But deeper inside I don't really care what they would feel or go trough if I were to check myself out early. But I probably wont do it. I have forgot what thought loop lead me to write this short ramble, I am drunk right now. But this is how I think and feel alot of the time. Please direct me to a more suitable sub if this shouldn't be posted here. Thanks for reading.",suicide,0.79683346,0.44844857,0.3843923,0.44001484,0.2280455

The thing is my friend reckons she's off her rocker and she's not listening but I think you guys can do something. She threw away her phone so, I'm not able to contact her.

That's all I know, now it's your turn. Can you help her out ? or is it impossible ?

**EDIT2:** I just learned she has no family. I guess it really is asking too much. :(

**EDIT3:** I just learned that she's **/** years old and that she's supposedly going to jump off a bridge.

**EDIT4:** My friend thinks she has a kid and she needs money. But my friend isn't sure.

**EDIT5:** Tried calling the UK suicide hotline a couple of times, but it's unavailable. Any thoughts ?

**EDIT6:** Can someone from the UK please try to do something ? All details are provided above. Everything *I* know, atleast.. Sheesh, I wish I could do more.

**EDIT8:** No more information received. I don't know what happened. I'll keep you guys posted.

**EDIT9:** Hey guys, I told you I'd keep you updated, so here it is: Apparently, K******* jumped; but I guess the bridge wasn't high enough so, she survived it and now she's recovering slowly in the hospital!

30284,"After testing both sides, I can confirm that girls are way more complicated in terms of dating and whatnot Allow me to explain. I’m a 16 year old dude and I came out as bisexual in eighth grade. I’ve dated two females and one male since then (currently single). Here’s what I’ve learned.

*Boys*
Boys are dumb. There’s no getting around that lol. While it’s true that there are quite a bit of smart dudes out there, they’re all dumb. We can’t take hints for the life of us, so it’s much better to be blunt if you’re hitting on a guy. It’ll go much better if you do.

Maybe it’s just me and my ex-bf, but I picked up the vibe that guys typically find excessive clinging a turn off. I mean, we love commitment and dedication, but I personally find it a little annoying if someone is constantly trying to go on dates (by which I mean all day every day). Maybe this is a no brained but I put it on here anyway.

Guys love cuddling almost as much as girls. Non sexual physical contact for excessive periods of time feels absolutely amazing for us. It’s an amazing feeling, as it’s intimate yet friendly at the same time.

*Girls*
Girls are usually dedicated almost to a fault. Having a gf is a huge responsibility. I don’t mean to degrade women at all by this, but having a gf can be compared to having a pet. They require quite a bit of attention, but they more than reciprocate if you meet their needs. It’s tiring but wonderful at the same time. Worth every minute

Girls take breakups pretty hard. Even if the breakup is for a logical reason such as distance or different values, they seem to always take it personally. It’s super hard to convey thoughts and emotions, especially as a teen, so make sure you’re extra careful around women.

Anyway that’s it. Enjoy :)",non-suicide,"After testing both sides, I can confirm that girls are way more complicated in terms of dating and whatnot Allow me to explain.

This isn't to say it couldn't be tomorrow or that it couldn't be in five years. I only mean that I'm almost certain of it and it's how I *want* to die. I think I should be in control of when and how I die, you know, other than accidental death or murder. It's selfish, sure, but it's a personal choice that people make all the time and I want that choice for myself, too.  

 I find myself often thinking it would be okay if this car coming at me would suddenly swerve into my lane at 60 mph. It would be okay if I died in my sleep and never woke up. Dying will be okay. It's oblivion and I want it more and more all the time- more so than life or experience.  

I'm 31 years old, and while I know that I haven't seen everything, felt everything, been everywhere, or learned all there is to learn, I don't think it matters. When I'm dead none of this will matter and everything I do in life will be as if it never happened. 

My mother took her own life a little over two years ago. For a while I thought only of how selfish she was- and it burned a scar into my heart that will never fully heal. But I want to tell her that I get it, even though I don't think she knew what she was doing when she killed herself. She was fucked up on drugs and essentially trying to avoid going back to prison. I sometimes think she didn't mean to be successful and hoped it would win her sympathy, as she had done that once years before.   

When she succeeded and I found out, it took my thinking into new territory that I didn't know existed: We're all going to die. All my life I think I never really believed it- a youth being a youth- but suddenly it was real and it took my mother.  
  
 She gave herself to it. And she's gone and I can never talk to her again. I can never ask why or did she, oops, not really mean to? I want to tell her that she pulled the rug out from under us right before I was going to do it. I want to tell her that I've put the rug back but I'm still thinking about it almost every moment of every day. 

Those left of my family, my brother and sister and my dad and step-mom, my grandmothers, and very few friends- I can't talk to them about this. I can't get their *permission*, and I know they would never be okay with it. In fact, it would probably piss most people off. So it's my secret and I keep it. Except here right now because I fucking want to tell someone anonymous.  

I know how much it is going to hurt certain people. The only reason I really haven't yet is because of them, but I know I can't keep this up.
 I'm going to kill myself. I really doubt I could be talked out of it. I've read and enjoyed some of the most uplifting shit in the world, and the most negative shit doesn't make me feel hopeless. It's not that I feel depressed or hopeless anyway. It's just that I'm tired of life. I'm tired of waking up every day. I'm tired of the grind. I make music and I paint and I write and none of it matters because ultimately everything will be gone. I work to pay bills that I would rather laugh at. I eat because I have to, not because I want to. Life is inherently pointless. I know that I've got to make my own happiness and give myself purpose. No one can or will do it for me.... and I don't want them to. I just want out.

I just think that if they now want to enforce masks they should be paying the hazard pay again because clearly the pandemic isn’t over.

My mother worked double time and odd jobs just to make ends meet and keep a roof over our heads and food on the table for my little brothers and myself. Graduated HS and went onto college to meet what I thought was the love of my life. I wasn’t a virgin but also hadn’t been w “a lot” of women either, under 4. Anyway, met her and began a 5 year romance and relationship w her. Included graduating college, getting our first apartment together, getting married and having a little girl together. One night in the middle of being dad, I can’t say why this happened only theories. Sleep deprivation, moodiness, problems within the marriage itself, we got physical w each other. Nothing horrible like you always hear about but enough to where she pressed charges and tried to take my daughter from me. She had a bruise on her bicep where I grabbed her, she left nail marks on my neck etc. no blood, no busted bones, no damaged furniture. I was scared, I had lost my wife, my newborn daughter who was only 3 months at the time, my job (because of the local news) printing the allegations, and our apartment lease was up. She moved and took everything we had either bought together or were gifted during the wedding or baby shower. I moved back in w my mother at age 33, after 52 days of trying to be strong and endure the never ending, relentless pain, I made the horrifying decision one night to write my suicide notes and leave my pin # for the debit card, my wedding band and my wallet on the passenger side of my vehicle. I walked to the nearest overpass (about 35 ft) up and sent a goodbye text to my wife and called my brother and let him know that I loved him. I closed my eyes and fell. I hit the cement below w such impact that I knew I was injured pretty bad. I tried to get up and into a standing position and my hip buckled. I then laid under the bridge w oncoming traffic passing me by for the next 6+ hours in 20 degree weather passing in and out of consciousness. My mother knew something was wrong and issued a missing person’s report. The EMTS found me and loaded me up on the gurney. I never screamed so loud in my life, I knew my back was severely messed up when they slid the board underneath me. I was so cold that I didn’t even register a pulse on their machines. I passed out in the ambulance on the way to ICU. My first time waking up, I remember being under what seemed to me at the time; like a giant heated pool cover. They kept me under that for 3 days until I finally stabilized, as well as a back brace to keep my shattered pelvis and hip together. I was administered every two hours w dilaudid into a pic line.  It says half life for that medicine was 4 hours but believe me when I tell you it seemed like it wore off so much quicker than that.

My pelvis was shattered on the right side w an incomplete break of the tailbone, I had a few broken ribs, and two lower lumbar vertebrae shattered in my back.

181035,"I don't know why I'm posting this.It's probably going to be lengthy, and I'll probably jump from problem to problem and most likely get someone reading this confused and uninterested. I apologize in advance.
I'm seventeen years old, and i'm a female.

I really really don't know how to start so I'll just start listing problems I've had.

Never met my father, as of a year ago I found his Facebook (I didn't request him or anything, it was a random spur of curiosity - I've never really cared much about knowing about him until a few years ago, and yes, I'm 100% sure that the Facebook I found was him), and found out that he has a family. This sounds really wrong, but it makes me wonder what that family had to have him stay, and what made him ditch my mom once he heard she was pregnant. It makes me feel betrayed. Very alone, and very betrayed. I was talking to one of two of my close friends last night about it, and he said he thinks all of my problems root from this. It got me thinking, and it's gotten me severely down.

I started self-harm in sixth grade, and it continued until about 9 months ago. Two years ago I had cut my leg too deep, and was scared and ended up confessing to my mother, who put me in therapy. Therapy didn't help, I didn't open up to her, and I didn't feel comfortable with her. All she ever did was give me breathing exercises to get rid of my anxiety, which only helped for so long. (I have pretty bad social anxiety, and just anxiety in general, and also have a lot of shaking episodes if I dwell too much on things.) We moved, never went to therapy again. But thinking about my father last night has given me urges I thought would never return.
 
I've been with my boyfriend (LDR relationship) for 8 months as of yesterday. We've already seen each other twice, he stayed at my house for a week two months ago, and I just got back yesterday from a two week trip to his house. He's romantic, sweet, a gentleman - opens doors for me, manners, and all that, has good hygiene, plan for the future. He's a country boy as well. What i'm trying to say is he's the ""perfect guy."" 
I was really really, truly happy for the first 5 months. I had gotten confidence in myself, started losing weight like I've been wanting to. 

But after he had left here, I started to get depressed again, I pushed him away, became suspicious over everything he did because I had found out he lied to me once, and I just couldn't get over it. I'm still not over it, and I'm still very suspicious. While I was there for two weeks, I constantly snapped at him, and then I would hug/love him as if I weren't a complete bitch to him 20 minutes prior. It was like punching someone in the face, then getting ice for them.

I know I need help with this. I don't know why I can't deal with the fact that people mess up sometimes, people lie sometimes. I act like I'm fucking perfect, and when someone messes up, I just cannot EVER get over it, and I hold the worst grudges. Shit, I mean, I've lied to him before, nothing big, but a lie is a lie. I don't understand how I can admit I need help, but once I get the help I need, I pretty much wait for things to fall apart because I know they will. I have no idea how to cope with anything that's handed to me, because the only way I've ever coped with anything was to grab a razor. And I'm trying not to do that again.

There's a whole 'nother slew of problems that I really don't feel like writing out because I don't think it's worth it. So, I'll sum it up. 

* Since we moved, my social anxiety has gotten worse and my mom thinks it's just me being shy, and won't take my seriously. 

* My only close friends live in Canada, which makes me feel even more alone than I already am.
 
* Since moving, I literally have no one to talk to, and have zero friends at school. I'm not even joking. I've tried making friends, but they all act like I'm a virus since I don't wear Hollister. (I go to a really snobby school. If you don't wear designer, you aren't even in existence.) The only person in my new school that I've talked to was my bus driver. 

* My mom hasn't had a job for years, and we're barely getting by right now, if that, we have a nice landlord who has brushed off the fact that we haven't paid rent in two months. Unfortunately, our landlord is losing her mind, her son might take over, and he's not as nice as her. But it's understandable. We owe them so much.

* My family is falling apart because of money, and I lost my favorite relative to this huge fight over it.

* I am just no where near prepared for the real world. And I'm now a senior. I have no idea what I'm going to do after highschool. I had planned to live with my boyfriend, but I don't know what's going to happen to us because my feelings are all messed up and I don't know how much longer he's going to stick by my side and deal with it all.

* I'm trying to get prepared for the real world, but I can't because, 1) My mom never takes me out to go job hunting like I constantly ask her to. (hypocrite me is partially happy because I won't have to deal with people) 2) I got a credit card for myself so I could learn how to use it/learn how banks work, but my mother has also taken that because it's easier for her to use since she can do direct deposits. 

I really don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know how I can be so cold-hearted towards people and just not care. I'm a selfish hypocrite. I want help, but I want the sadness and it's a constant cycle of wanting and needing and it's driving me insane. I feel like I'm killing myself of any good feelings/thoughts. And then I'll think I'm being a typical teenage girl, and then I'll have deep conversations with my best friend, and I'll think ""No way does she have the same, fucked up thoughts that I do.""

I feel like my boyfriend could get a girl that has her shit straight, and my best friend wouldn't have to deal with so much of my shit if I just weren't around. And I'm honestly considering it, which I guess is why I'm posting it here.

I feel like a typical teenage girl with daddy problems, and it sickens me. Can someone just be straight forward with me, please?",suicide,"I don't know why I'm posting this.It's probably going to be lengthy, and I'll probably jump from problem to problem and most likely get someone reading this confused and uninterested. I apologize in advance. I'm seventeen years old, and i'm a female. I really really don't know how to start so I'll just start listing problems I've had. Never met my father, as of a year ago I found his Facebook (I didn't request him or anything, it was a random spur of curiosity - I've never really cared much about knowing about him until a few years ago, and yes, I'm 100% sure that the Facebook I found was him), and found out that he has a family. This sounds really wrong, but it makes me wonder what that family had to have him stay, and what made him ditch my mom once he heard she was pregnant. It makes me feel betrayed. Very alone, and very betrayed. I was talking to one of two of my close friends last night about it, and he said he thinks all of my problems root from this. It got me thinking, and it's gotten me severely down. I started self-harm in sixth grade, and it continued until about 9 months ago. Two years ago I had cut my leg too deep, and was scared and ended up confessing to my mother, who put me in therapy. Therapy didn't help, I didn't open up to her, and I didn't feel comfortable with her. All she ever did was give me breathing exercises to get rid of my anxiety, which only helped for so long. (I have pretty bad social anxiety, and just anxiety in general, and also have a lot of shaking episodes if I dwell too much on things.) We moved, never went to therapy again. But thinking about my father last night has given me urges I thought would never return. I've been with my boyfriend (LDR relationship) for 8 months as of yesterday. We've already seen each other twice, he stayed at my house for a week two months ago, and I just got back yesterday from a two week trip to his house.

We entered university at the same year and we're in our last year of study.

I discovered this sub only today, and I read the risk assessment guide. It scared me to hell because my friend shows several high risk symptoms. He thinks he's a burden to his mom and that everyone will be better off without him. Our peer group members have all graduated and moved to a different city, leaving him without support. He has explicitly told his family that he's gonna do it in August (this month!) and has made up his mind to submit a resignation letter to the university.

He doesn't wanna disclose his plan, that's why I thought he was merely seeking attention. He has told us that he won't change his mind and that he doesn't want help and he doesn't wanna be recovered from depression. He has stopped seeing a psychiatrist.

132769,"The Longer I Live, The More I Want To Die.I've come to a point in my life, once again, where I'm growing increasingly suicidal. Just a few nights ago, a situation came up, where my god awful birth mother had the nerve to basically demand my brother (who was turning 17 the NEXT FUCKING DAY), that he move back in with her. He has finally learned throughout the past few years how abusive she was to us, how manipulative she was, and finally moved in with us. I wasn't there the whole time before. I had been living with my grandparents, but my grandfather kept emotionally and mentally abusing me. Every little thing was a disappointment and if I had stayed any longer, I was going to kill myself or him. Either one was bad, and I knew that. I called up my step mom and they had me move in right away. Months and months later, we moved back to my hometown and state (to support and help my brother, who had broken his hip in a sports accident. Mom wasn't bringing him to physical therapy and the home environment was AWFUL). Everything was good for a while once we moved into the new house. A good two months went by, and then I decided I was finally going to get my first job. As a mentally ill 18 year gay trans male, sometimes things were- VERY hard for me. I decided to apply for the McDonald's very close to our house. A 5 minute walk if that and boom, I was there. Of course I had anxiety on the job interview, but it wasn't bad. Was hired on the spot because I had a VERY open schedule, and I had orientation just days later. All went well, and I was training in no time. Now, this is where things got even worse. 2 weeks into the job and I was growing more suicidal, people were calling me ""she"" no matter how well I passed. I had a male uniform, Had my hair cut super short, wore my chest binder and even made sure to speak in a raspier, deeper version of my own voice. This KILLED my confidence and I cried every night I came home from work. My boyfriend at the time tried to help but I was was always far too depressed. I'd usually just smoke some pot, get happy again, ect- but soon I was having trouble even doing that. I wanted to kill myself. I was starting to plan, but then I snapped out of it again, told my parents about how stressed I was, and quit. Dad planned to help me get on disability so I could get money that way- because by that point I was switching between alters, my hallucinations were coming back hard, I was paranoid about everyone and everything- I was a mess. Soon, the family was struggling with money. I tried to keep doing stuff around the house, my brother was starting to look for jobs too. Suddenly, my panic attacks were becoming crippling. My first really bad panic attack happened after a night of being at my friend's house. She lives alone with her fiance, and I've stayed there before- but I was up ALL NIGHT. I couldn't sleep, and part of me blamed the energy drinks I had during the day. I never had a bad reaction to them, though, so I was so confused as to what was happening. Dad eventually wanted to pick me up, and while I waited for him outside, I got the worst feeling of my life. My eyes started rapidly twitching, my hands and face were going numb, I was gagging, my heart was pounding, my fingers felt oddly tense and I nearly blacked out. Fast forward a week to my next panic attack exactly one week later. Once again, I didn't sleep all night, but this time I didn't have ANY caffeine. I was starting to feel sick again. Nausea was always a breaking point for me since I have an extreme fear of nausea and anything vomit related. I was in my brother's room with his girlfriend when I suddenly had the urge to vomit. Got up, held in a gag, and realized my parents were in the shower. I managed to breathe through some of the nausea, sitting down on the floor. That's when the eye twitching and numbing started up. I called out to my brother and said that something felt REALLY wrong. Not minutes later did the worst symptom I've ever had happen. My body started to lock up. I turned into a human statue, only I could just barely move my back muscles. My wrists were bent so bad from the lockage that my right thumb was nearly touching my wrist, and my left one was almost as bad. My fingers were forcefully straightened, my shoulders were locked- it felt like I was being possessed. I could hardly breathe and by that point, my brother was trying to get the attention of our dad and step mom, and my brother's girlfriend had her hand on my chest to feel my heart beat. She said to me later that it was slowing down and speeding up randomly. Fast forward again to a while later- I had another one. But nobody was home this time. Not a soul. And what was worse? The internet went down. I had and still do not have phone service. That's when panic really set in. Nobody was there to help in case shit got real. I tried fixing the internet but nothing worked, and then eventually, I was debating on dialing 911. The nausea was getting to the point where I was leaning over the kitchen sink, nose dripping as I sobbed, and I started feeling myself going numb and my fingers felt partially stiff. I knew nobody might be home for HOURS, so I ended up calling 911. That landed me in the hospital, and the next, the psych ward floor of that hospital because of the suicidal thoughts that came with that after I was in a room. I felt constantly sick and was not okay. Fast forward again, close to 2 months after I was finally released- not because I wanted to but because I ""wasn't a danger to myself or others"" and ""seemed to be stable"". I had a horrible anxiety attack not two hours after I was home, and then stuff got worse. Money issues were worse than ever before, dad was spending a lot on beer, we could barely keep up with rent- and then... they decided to 'separate'. I wanted to kill myself the day he told me we were moving back to (insert state I moved to after I left my grandparents house). I had a plan and I was semi ready to do it. My brother, however, tried to keep me positive despite him also breaking down into tears (which I almost NEVER see happen). We finally moved here, but not to the place we thought. Instead of moving in with my second pair of grandparents (because of my druggy aunt and disgusting uncle- who isn't paying rent. Yet he refused to take us over them), and into our other aunt's house. It wouldn't be so bad, but my anxiety is through the roof, my depression set in again, and there's a kid here who just LOVES to be abusive and throw fits no matter how hard my aunt tries to control him. My brother is now gone, and I've been thinking about suicide again. I've never had thoughts or plans this serious before , and I even have the attitude of not caring about accidental death. My heart beat got funny last night and all I could think to myself was ""I hope it's a heart attack"" or something. I don't know if I'm going to make it to my birthday in a month.

My cat was walking around on my desk and he stepped on my computer. I didnt notice this, so not only did i continue talking to my friend, but i was narrating what my cat was doing.

My cat sat down and i was petting him and booping his nose. I said to my friend “im annoying my cat.” And then. I literally. Meowed. In a sexy cat voice. 

“Im annoying my cat. mrrrr-owww. maxxyyy. im being so babb rawrrrr”

My friend, who finally noticed this just whispered as lowly as possible “youre unmuted”

I just looked at the screen, resisted the urge to go die, and promptly exited the meeting. 

My friend then informed me that not only did everyone hear us talking, the meow, and me talking in my being-sweet-to-my-cat-voice, they  also just stopped the lesson and were just starting at me. They heard me talk for at least a minute. They heard me talk to my friend who was also in the class. They heard him laugh. they heard me go insane.

164235,"The pain inside of me is so unbelievable. I don't think I can keep doing this much longer.How do I stick it out with these constant urges to die? I spend hours every day thinking about the best way to kill myself. But I can't bring myself to do it because I don't want to hurt my family. It's just getting so much worse lately that I don't know if I can stick it out for them much longer.

My disordered eating and related thoughts have become so obsessive lately. I'm losing weight but it's not enough. I feel so bad when I go over 500 calories. I had exactly 800 yesterday along with my 30 min on the elliptical and it just feels disgusting. I want to go lower but when I try to eat very little I end up throwing up my meds (I can taste them coming up). 

I'm trying really hard to not purge because I read that it doesn't even help you not absorb the calories so there's not much point but for some reason I keep doing it anyway. And I also do it at weird times like when I'm really upset even if I haven't eaten recently. It's hard though because I feel the fat growing on my arms and hips after I eat and then i need to get it to stop growing by getting the food out. 

And the exercise. My depression makes me weak so occasionally when I work out I'll pass out after. It's happened only a handful of times but I did accidentally fall off the elliptical once when I fainted. So my mom has been working from home and supervising me and only letting me do 30 min. It sucks and I feel so guilty. That's not enough calories burned.

Now, and here's where I'm hopeless, my doctor just prescribed me seroquel. I already had genomic testing done and it said that this is unlikely to work for me but whatever. My issue is that it's probably going to make me gain weight. It can mess with your adiponectin, leptin, and ghrelin levels, not to mention, increase appetite.

I cannot gain weight. I just lost 15 lbs. my doctor said if I gain 1 lb back we'll stop it, but what if I gain more than that during the week?

And then I come across all the stuff online about how much fat people should die and kill themselves and stuff like that and... Maybe I should. I'm a woman and I'm overweight. I keep reading that this is like the worst possible thing to be and honestly it really does suck. I used to be a healthy weight and ever since I gained weight I'm treated so differently. But I've put all my energy into fighting my depression for most of the past decade. Also my weight has yo-yo'ed. I tend to go back to normal when my depression goes away (which is rare and doesn't last long).

But like it's so hard to fight depression and fight my weight. I cry while I work out. It doesn't make me feel better at all. I feel like I'll never get back to normal if I take this med and gain weight. But how will I get better without the med? There is no winning. So I think my time might be up.

I also got a card in the mail today from my mom mom saying she misses me and it says ""how does spaghetti sound?"" Because she loves to cook for people and I guess she wants me to come see her but... I can't eat that. I would have to throw it up. If that's not a sign then I don't know what is. I broke down and cried so hard when I read that. I love and miss her so much and j just wish so hard I could eat and enjoy her spaghetti.

I know all of this is so incredibly trivial and I'm sorry to spend so much time whining but the pain I feel is not trivial. It is so intense and just... Unreal. I can't even describe it because words don't do it justice. I wouldn't wish this pain on anyone, not even the man who raped me. 

I hope this made sense. It took me almost an hour to type out in between fits of crying. I'll try to reply if I get a response but I'm really at the edge here and I don't know that I'll make it through the night. I'm okay with that but I don't want to be so I really need someone to convince me otherwise. Please

So let’s start with the 2 people

Mom: so my mom wanted a chicken nugget but I already started the fryer so I didn’t make her one (I know I’m an ass hole but plz keep reading) 

My older sister: she was downstairs eating a chicken salad sandwich and chips. That’s all I have of her

Do people with rooms in there just have a different kind of attic or something? I have one with a door on my ceiling with a ladder and I have another that you just go through with a door like a normal room.

129163,"Can't even sleep anymore.I'm getting truly desperate in life. I'm a 20 year old male. My parents went through a rough divorce when I was around 12. My dad's been an alcoholic my whole life. I never thought these things affected me but now I'm not so sure. I had a good life in school, had lots of friends and played sports. I met a girl when I turned 16. She made me happy and I spent everyday with her. This was the happiest I have ever been but obviously it didn't last. I had my first taste of heartbreak and I turned heavily to drugs. I live on an island so starting using darknet markets to get drugs from a very young age. This gave me access to anything I wanted. I started taking loads of Ecstasy pills after my break up (bearing in mind I wasn't testing shit so fuck knows what I was taking) and using cannabis to sleep. I seen the way people who sold pills got treated by everyone. People got excited when they were around. I wanted that. So regretfully against my Morales I starting selling and ordering them for people. A boy then died of a Cardiac arrest after taking to many pills. I truthfully don't know if it was pills I brought up or if it was someone else's as there was so many about back then. People on the island blamed me for it though and things starting happening. That's something I'll carry with me for the rest of my life and rightfully so. I pray that it wasn't the pills I was bringing up that he OD' on but either way I knew what I was doing was Morally wrong but I still did it. I lost all the friends I had in school because they didn't want anything to do with the way I was behaving so I can't blame them for that. I never touched an Ecstasy tablet again. 

Fast forward a year or two of not being up to much except trying to keep myself sedated with whatever I had handy my mum started to become sick of me. I was kicked out and couldn't live with my dad and his wife because if anyone had tried to live with 2 alcoholics then I'm sure you can understand. I ended up living in a homeless shelter for a year and this very nearly destroyed me. I was taking Xanax and Valium and ended up with a pretty bad addiction. I decided to stop this cold turkey one day and since then nothing has brought me even momentary happiness. Few months later I started drinking GHB daily. My mum then let me move back in and one day she found me in a severe GHB coma and paramedics were called. I then stopped using GHB and have been trying and failing to remain sober. My vices now are weed and alcohol. If I could sleep well then I'd put them both down but I seem to have bad insomnia.

People always say ask for help but I genuinely am but no one is coming to help. My mum and dad don't get it and seem to busy in there own lives for me. I've expressed to them how suicidal I am probably in the hopes that they would do something but they don't. The mental health services on my island are virtually non existent so even going to doctors is pointless which I've tried. I guess you have to attempt suicide before anyone believes you. I've applied for online CBT so I'll see how that goes. On the other hand I'm waiting on opiates coming so I'll probably end up with another addiction or maybe be brave enough to eat the whole lot and hopefully not wake up. Might sound odd to people that I'm going out of my way to buy something I know I'll probably get addicted to but in all honesty I prefer to be an addict than feel the way I currently do.

First off, I’m placed in a hospital bed, to be then moved to the ER hallway (the hallway for people that have used self-harm, threatened suicide and or are mentally unstable). Now, I don’t really care that I’m laying in a bed, in a hallway for people that are at risk of killing themselves, but I could see how embarrassing it can be for people. Anyways, you have to lay in your bed until a nurse checks up on you, possibly checks your vitals and or a psychiatrist might see you (but since the hospital is typically crowded, it can take up to 2-3 days for him or her to see you.

The 3 times I’ve been there, you have to wait in your bed for at least 1 whole day (or night) to be then placed in the adult psychward. One time I had to wait 3.5 days until I was placed there.

Don't be embarrassed to say like I was, otherwise you'll risk infertility and absolute fucking agony.

Don't be afraid to say about this stuff to people.

64243,"My dad’s been a dick to me for such a long time and has expected me to still be happy to come over to his house. Should I just hit fuck it and give him shit until he stops? So for the longest time my dad and I have not gotten along. I have divorced parents and I have to go over to his house every other weekend. For the past year things have really taken a turn for the worse. He just talks without thinking, becomes rude when talking about my mom, and is annoyingly homophobic. Most recently, he backed into my car (that he had no place in buying at all) and when I came out to see, I said something like “jesus christ.” Mind you, this was directed at the damage, not him. I went inside and he then said that the insurance company had it all under control. He went on to say that my reaction was out of line and that he has never seem someone so immature. On top of this, once I got my car fixed he then told me to thank him for hitting my car because the car now looks better (it looks the same). I jokingly said I don’t think I will, and he further decided to take it seriously. Not only this, but there have been countless times where he’s just casually judgmental about everything. Some time last year I told him I didn’t want to come over anymore, but now he just acts like that never happened. In fact, he acts like nothing ever happens and then makes me out to be this neglecting ass. He’s also the reason I will never go out of the country as a minor, because he believes that my mom would “steal me” which makes no legal sense.   

So, the thing I have to ask is if I should just shut him out completely until he changes? I had this plan earlier today to just stop talking to him entirely or be honest when he asks in his cutesy way about hanging out with him? Trying to find middle ground has never works, as I’m always the one to change and he remains to stay the same. I’d stop if he changed and let me have a passport. My other option is just to wait through another two years.

234650,"Just need someoneHi, 
I've never really felt this low. But I just need someone. Someone to talk to and listen. 
I'm 23. I have a normal boring life. I work full time. No real problems. My boyfriend and I have been together 5 years. We moved to a bigger new city on our own about 4 years ago. We have done well and gone through a lot together. Naturally we left our families (tho both very unstable) and our friends. We always said we would go home once a.month but once a month turned into once every 6 months. And now it's really only for Christmas. I knew starting over would be hard. When we first moved I was in college and thought I'd make a million friends and go out etc. But none of that happened. I found it difficult to meet people and keep friendships. Once I was done with school, all I did was work. I have ""work friends"". And I had a few friendships where we went out and hung out but they didn't last long. I am very much an introvert and need my alone time. Sometimes I feel like I have trouble relating to people. The last 2 years have been especially rough. All my friends back home barely remember me and don't text back. I have no one to talk to. If I'm not working I'm at home laying in bed. I don't even want to get dressed some days. I do have social anxiety with big groups and being afraid of talking to new people which has been the set back of all of this. I'm just so lonely. Like i feel it in my chest. Like so hollow and sad. My boyfriend and I have grown apart. No longer teenagers in love. We don't like the same anything anymore. We both have worked so much in the last few years to stay a float that we never went out on dates or were romantic. He doesn't get it. Years ago i tried to explain how lonely and sad I was and that sometimes I didn't even know why I was sad. But he doesn't understand and just shuts me down. All of the pressure is on me. He doesn't have his license so I drive him to and from work. He makes good money but I take care of the bills and make sure things are paid and caught up. I do the laundry and dishes and keep the house spotless. I know most depressed people can't even get out of bed to clean but I think I have ocd or somethi g because I have to clean. Things have to be organized and in their place or I can't think. I scrub and Lysol everything most days. There are things I would like to do. Like yoga and hiking and going to more concerts but it's like I make a plan but never follow through. I know it's all really me and my fault. Sometimes I want to text one of my old friends and tell them hey I really want to die sometimes and I'm so lonely but I fear I'll just be bothering them and they won't understand. My best friend committed suicide 5 years ago in April and we were supposed to move together and go to school but everything got the best of her. I know if she was here she would understand. I know that even if I had friends Idk if I would be a good one. I used to have a lot of friends and I was never home. I was always interacting with people. Idk what happened. Idk what changed me into this anti social awkward person that can't really care. Like at work people talk about their kids or their life. And if something bad happens others will hug them and what not. I just don't feel that for other people. But yet I'm dying for attention. Idk I'm so fucked up.. ugh. Well sorry for the rambling.

She was the only person that talked to me on lunch breaks, would usually share homework and help me with history and I helped her with math. Things were going great, but she was always really physically close to me, she would rest her head on my shoulder, hug me pretty often, heck she was so close to me she would even cry knowing I would make things better.

so turns out, I thought she was telling me that she liked me in a romantic way, and I told her I liked her. I still believe this was a mistake.

she said she didn't like me back, and the next day she just wasn't doing the same things, we wouldn't have the same conversations, she didn't hug me, or even touch me for almost a year.

a year later she actually apologized for all of it, she said she felt nervous close to me and didn't know what to do, she still would kinda avoid my hugs and sometimes freak out if I tried hugging her because it made her nervous. even after her apologies I still struggle telling my emotions to others, because I think this will happen again.

139758,"Sad Written thingsI keep a digital journal just in case i randomly die... i need people to know that i was not ok and that im still not ok :(.

Explantion time 👏👏

I am a sad individual. As a kid my parents would only give their praze to my older sibling.... they would talk about how great she was to everyone while i ment nothing to them. I would sit on the side lines while they would talk about how pretty and smart she was. I grew up thinking i was ugly. Yeah! Tough times.

One time my dad out right told me to get up of the couch and give it to my sister cuz she was a girl... 
My dads abit of a sexist
Or maybe its cuz i knew about his porn collection

Still it was abundantly clear to me that i was the least loved in the family.

I always tought about killing myself but i never had the balls to try it out....
or did i? Dun dun dunnn!
On the subject of balls n shit my mom once said i should wear a dress.... :/ 
(and no it wasnt even this nice but i dont really want to explain my whole life) 

At one point my mom didnt consider that i was her son just because i implied that she had a boy friend at a family reunion. At that point i already felt like a strange in my own family... so i distanced myself from them.

A couple of months ago i drank some detergent as a means to end it all.... and suprice suprice im not dead but at the same time i really did fuck up my throut ( never talked to them about it). I realised some thing that day and that was, that i was scared to die and that im not gonna kill myself.
(Btw drinking chemicals is never a good way to go... trust me!)

If u think i should see a therapist i cant afford it + i cant explain all this to my disfunctional family.

Im doing honestly better but i need people to know that shit like this happens, maybe even worse.

All i know is that having a journal is a greaf way to release stress especially in a case like mine.

On that note do u all ever wonder how people would feel if you were to one day die and realise how much pain they caused? Cuz i think about that alot and i find peace in the fact they will suffer on the inside for what theyve done.

I might sond like an asshole but im being truthful... thus this post.

People have avoided me and called me weird for as long as I can remember. I don’t have any friends left in real life because I sabotage all my relationships to avoid feeling vulnerable.

I have Tourette’s and BDD and OCPD and really severe ADHD and I’ve only grown out of kleptomania relatively recently. I don’t think there’s anything good underneath all the shittiness that’s accumulated in me over the years. I dropped out of high school because I just couldn’t handle what everybody else was able to. I left the Mormon church and became an atheist because I couldn’t live up to all the expectations.

I know I’m smart, but somehow that makes me feel worse. I’m totally dysfunctional and smart people are supposed to be good at things. I can’t make myself do anything, I’m just an idiot who’s in way over her head. I feel so lazy and stupid. I wanted to have a career in astronomy, stellar spectroscopy in particular, but if history’s taught me anything, it’s that I wouldn’t be able to succeed in that or anything else no matter how hard I tried. Math is one of the only things I enjoy anymore and I’m not even good at it.

I can’t stand feeling so empty and panicky all the time. I’m a controlling, anxious, remorseless asshole.

I started taking Wellbutrin (450 mg) during my last depressive episode in September 2017. It helped way more than Prozac, which made me even more anxious, and Cymbalta, which made me suicidal. I was still depressed on Wellbutrin but much less so. My emotions were just dampened, not totally gone like they are now. I felt so much better.

My guess is that since my depression makes me so exhausted and numb, I need both dopamine and norepinephrine, but my serotonin levels are generally fine so messing with them fucks everything up. The Wellbutrin’s lost effectiveness though. As far as I know, 450 mg is the maximum dose. I don’t know how else to fix myself.

I’ve hated myself for most of my life. I remember hating myself in preschool. I don’t think I was meant to live this long. I’ll be giving natural selection a hand.

4 months ago my friend who we'll call ""John"" got into a fight with my boss who we'll simply call ""Boss"" after Boss was looking for his first dime and he accused John of stealing it, after about 2 minutes of fighting John squeezed Boss's eyes and walked out.

I tried to convince John not to quit but John made up his mind.

1 week later I found John living in a cardboard box (which was confiscated by the bank) and I noticed he was eating one of his paintings, I offered to let John stay at my house, after a few minutes he accepted.

The first night was decent,  he only requested simple stuff so over time around 1 week later he got a little more demanding and my cat was getting annoyed.

1 month later I was getting pissed but was to scared to say anything.

Then so much time has passed that the old narrator got tired of waiting and they had to hire a new one.

I was reaching my breaking point and after he had me wear a french maid uniform (im a guy) I had enough and gave very obvious hints that he should get a new job and after 5 minutes of bickering I had enough, I broke the roof if my house and drove my bed to my work to confront my boss, heres our EXACT conversation.

""You want your dime back? TAKE IT!!! Now John can come back right?"" I said

""Wrong, that ain't me first dime."" Boss replied

""Well have some more dimes I got plenty of them!""

""You cant put a price on me first dime and I cand forgive that theiving billdrat John for stealing it.""

At this point I was done negotiating and i grabbed Boss in a chokehold and said ""Listen you Crustaceous Cheapskate Johns been living at my house driving me crazy and you're not going to hire him back all because of A STUPID DIME?!!??""

then the dime dropped out of his pocket but it didn't look like a dime so I said ""what's that?"" Boss replied with ""Me dime."" I asked if it was a dime and Boss said ""I've been in business a long time boy""

258123,"My take on religion This post is to express *my* personal views, and I do not wish any ill meaning toward any group of people.

Gods and Deity’s do exist-Millions of people will them to be, so whose to say that these invisible beings don’t have some control over the world just through sheer Thought power. I mean, let’s take the Christian God for an example. While there are disagreements within Christianity? They all share a similar cod of rules and idea of god. Through their collective thoughts of God, he exists. Christians believe certain this are wrong because God told them so. They believe it, and so he definitely has an influence over the world. 

You can take this and apply it to just about any dirty or god you want to. So by this thought process, **all** gods and Deity’s exist.

Now, About me. I am not religious, but kinda spiritual. I be live their are forces at be in the world greater than science can explain, but I also don’t want to serve them/worship them. I am a good person with good morals by most standards, and don’t need a book to tell me so. If an afterlife exists and I don’t make it there, oh well. I gain no more enjoyment of life by knowing there’s a being watching over me telling me to act a certain way-In fact, I enjoyed life less when I believed god for a fact existed.

Gods and Deity's do exist-Millions of people will them to be, so whose to say that these invisible beings don't have some control over the world just through sheer Thought power. I mean, let's take the Christian God for an example. While there are disagreements within Christianity? They all share a similar cod of rules and idea of god. Through their collective thoughts of God, he exists. Christians believe certain this are wrong because God told them so. They believe it, and so he definitely has an influence over the world. You can take this and apply it to just about any dirty or god you want to. So by this thought process, **all** gods and Deity's exist. Now, About me. I am not religious, but kinda spiritual. I be live their are forces at be in the world greater than science can explain, but I also don't want to serve them/worship them. I am a good person with good morals by most standards, and don't need a book to tell me so. If an afterlife exists and I don't make it there, oh well. I gain no more enjoyment of life by knowing there's a being watching over me telling me to act a certain way-In fact, I enjoyed life less when I believed god for a fact existed.

113300,"Bipolar episode resulted in wife initiating divorceHi all. Update to last week.

Bipolar 2, no meds because I can't manage the blood draw. Freaked out thrice. Supposed to be on Lithium.

Last week I had a low mood set in. My mind decided to fixate on something and beat me down. My wife has been pushed to the limits of my bipolarity. The hypomania can manifest in anxiety (I jumped out of a moving car in a parking lot en route to a blood draw. I don't like needles.) and the lows love to entrench me in suicidal fixation at their worst.

I wasn't quite in the suicidal mood, but the last few weeks I've felt disconnected from my wife. Body language. Not wanting affection. Responding to me like I'm an idiot with day to day questions (""How was your day?""). Hanging out with friends more and more. Even her upcoming birthday is an all girls gathering I was not invited to.

Many of her friends have just separated or are in the process of, and she's been hanging around them more and more.

I mention all this to underline that I am not insecure or needy. However, on this low, the disconnection spiraled out of control. I wanted to talk to her, not about it, just anything, occupy my mind, but I couldn't find her in the house.

She had gone outside to talk to one of her friends about their relationship problems. She came in and wanted to go direct to bed. I mentioned I was looking for her and had wanted to talk. She invited me to, but as she got into bed.

I didn't want to bother her with my stupid ideations. Then it just came out of my mouth.

""Do you want a divorce?""

""No,"" she said. ""Do you?""

""No. I just have this feeling lately. I'm sorry.""

""Would you like to see our couples therapist again?""

""I'll think about it.""

I tried to explain more of my mood, but she fell asleep.

I felt even lonelier. The suicidal thoughts came to mind. I drafter an open word-vomit letter to r/SuicideWatch. The site wouldn't take my post. Reminded me of the time I had called a crisis hotline and they hung up when they realized I was in the wrong zip code.

I felt lonelier and darker. I took the cord from my guitar amplifier and wrapped it around my neck. Tried to hang myself.

Didn't. Got myself free. I don't believe I was ever in any danger how I did it. I just wanted to feel something. 

I told my wife the next day. It was the day before she was leaving on a weekend trip. She fretted about me, and while I know how this sounds, I assured her (and assure you) that this incident was not intended to waylay her trip. It's just what I felt like doing.

She left on her trip.

I was still low, but I stayed active. As active as you can during depression. I cleaned the whole house, hand and knee, which felt like winning the Olympics in my depressive fugue. I wanted her to come back to something, to see I was pushing through the swings.

We were fine Sunday. Fine Monday. Fine Tuesday.

Tonight, dinner was like pulling teeth. She was cold, hostile.

I asked about the therapist.

She looked down. Didn't speak.

I had felt it for weeks. I knew then.

She told me she wanted a separation. Said it would be good for me. She's holding me back, I'm so productive when she's not around. Said we never had a marriage in the past eight years. Said she feels guilty for trying to reclaim her own life and mental health while leaving me at home to meet friends.

Said that I'd come out well in the separation settlements (she's the full-time worker). I said I didn't want any of that, I wanted my best friend, partner. She said she appreciates all the strides I've made, but that it was now too late.

I went upstairs to my office. Cried. Called my brother. Cried more. Called my dad. Sister. Mom and littlest sister called me. Spent all this night hurting, crying, understanding, not understanding.

I cried about our cats and what would happen with them. I hurt for losing my wife and being told we never had a real marriage for eight years. I got angry at myself and my disorder. I loathed myself. I thought about suicide, nothing specific. 

I just want to be done. To not feel. It hurts so much.

She came to check on me before bed. She had moved into the spare bedroom. Wanted to make sure I wasn't doing anything stupid. Said she cares about me, but she can't be my wife, can only be my friend. Too worn out from dealing with my moods. Tired of walking on eggshells.

I understand. It still hurts. It hurts when your best friend gives up on you.

She said nothing cause this, she was fine all weekend and yesterday. It was this morning. She woke up with clarity. Knew what had to be done.

I'm still ugly crying as I type this. I just want to reach some people, maybe be reached back. I feel so alone.

Everything hurts. Which is better than numb, I suppose.

I would like to be dead. I don't want to kill myself or harm myself. I would like to be done, though. This is a soul hurt.",suicide,"Bipolar episode resulted in wife initiating divorce. Hi all.

I hurt for losing my wife and being told we never had a real marriage for eight years. I got angry at myself and my disorder. I loathed myself. I thought about suicide, nothing specific. I just want to be done. To not feel. It hurts so much. She came to check on me before bed. She had moved into the spare bedroom. Wanted to make sure I wasn't doing anything stupid. Said she cares about me, but she can't be my wife, can only be my friend. Too worn out from dealing with my moods. Tired of walking on eggshells. I understand. It still hurts. It hurts when your best friend gives up on you. She said nothing cause this, she was fine all weekend and yesterday. It was this morning. She woke up with clarity. Knew what had to be done. I'm still ugly crying as I type this. I just want to reach some people, maybe be reached back. I feel so alone. Everything hurts. Which is better than numb, I suppose. I would like to be dead. I don't want to kill myself or harm myself. I would like to be done, though. This is a soul hurt.",suicide,0.74635005,0.8630446,0.6138515,0.36415428,0.61834365
2103,"Here's what's going on in Texas for those who don't know There was a big snowstorm a couple days ago. Gas is something you have to pay for there, which they voted on (red state). republicans dont think gas should be provided by the government and because they voted against it, it isn't. It was a really bad snowstorm as a result of climate change (one of the worst in texas history, and they don't get much snow there).

So, some people can't afford the gas and the concern is they'll freeze to death in their own homes because they don't have gas. Gas isn't just heat either, their water isn't being treated by the state right now and stoves aren't working to cook. 

At least 25 people have died as of 24 hours ago. To give you an idea of it 3 kids died when they accidentally lit their house on fire trying to stay warm and a man was found frozen to death in his recliner.

I found this girl on a dating app that turned out to be real (I know, shocker). We both go to the same college, so after a few days of talking I asked if she wanted to go on a date. She said yes immediately. We went out to get food (I saw some people from my old school there and tried to avoid them lol), and she refused to let me pay for her food (we used money that our school gave us, so it wasn't her own money per say). We sat and ate for a while and then went to the outdoor area.

At the outdoor area, we sat and just talked about literally anything for about an hour. Eventually, the benches we were sitting on became uncomfortable so we started walking around campus, again talking about anything. Even if there were breaks in the conversation, her smile always inspired me to think of a new subject. This continued for about another hour.

After this, she said that she needed to go back to her dorm to do laundry (we had been out for about 3 hours). I insisted that I walk her home because it was cold, but somehow it turned into her dropping me off at my place. Before I got out of the car, I asked how dates ended (this was my first ever date). She said however you wanted it to end, and I reached in for a hug. While we were awkwardly hugging over the center console in her Jeep, she unexpectedly kissed me on my cheek. I was shocked because this had never happened to me before.

I now realize that I should've kissed her back or given her a more legit hug, but I was a rookie and in shock. We have a second date scheduled for Saturday.

30964,"I HATE MY PARENTS AND MY GRANDMA Today was a bad day for me, I would say the worst day in the past two years. First of all I have Indian parents, I always thought that people exaggerated the stereotypical asian parents, but boi i was proven wrong today.

I got the results for my finals today and I was more than happy with what I got (68%) but I knew my parents wouldn't be happy with it.

Long story short when I told them about them my marks they called a massive failure and told me I'm gonna do worse the next year, they said I wont get into a single college and in their eyes I barely passed the exam, they said I wont even get any \*degrading job\* and told me to give up on my dreams.

I couldn't believe their response and worst of all my granny was also supporting them. I thought I would cry right there but I controlled myself and right after my granny went to the next room I heard her call someone and tell them my marks. This broke me and I was starting to tear up so I got up went to my room and I listened to some upbeat music to cheer me up but then my parents commanded me to return to them and they said they didn't allow me to leave but I ignored them. The only reason this got to me was cause they never scolded me for my marks ever before.

At this point I was just trying not to cry, I'm the type of person who's emotional but never cries. I never cry during tv shows, anime or movies. Then our maid came to check in on me, this took me over the edge cause my parents or my gradma couldn't bother to do this or they told her to check in on me. I asked her to leave and the floodgates were open, I lied face down on my bed and didn't wanna talk to anyone then slowly my dad and grandma came into my room and said something (I legit don't remember) then my sister came and she didn't say a single word and just slowly patted my back, then I slept for like 3 hours and while I was typing this my father came back from the gym and kinda apologized to me I'm saying this cause I'm not sure if its a guilt trap or an apology.",non-suicide,"I HATE MY PARENTS AND MY GRANDMA Today was a bad day for me, I would say the worst day in the past two years.

He stalked ppl and even sat in their houses without the owner's knowledge, it's dumb but ever science I heard about that it terrifying to think that someone like that could be watching me or family and we'd have no idea.

325962,"I bumped into my childhood Bully today. Well, i just wanna take it out my system, so, when I went to what In the US would be middle school, a new girl had entered the school, whom we'll call ""Fiona"" she was an scandalous girl, but nothing too bad, right?
So, i had two friends from kindergarten and one from the last year of elementary, we weren't exactly best friends, but we were kinda close, the kind of friends that always do the group projects togheter and work well.
One day, we saw Fiona alone, and we felt bad, so i suggested we went to ask her if she wanted to be with us, my friends agreed, so we went, she was really excited about the idea, so she started hanging out with us more often.
But she always was kind of mean to me, but I thought nothing of it, i just said ""Maybe she still needs to gain confidence in me too"" and shrugged it off.
Then, one day I couldn't go to school since i had the flu, it was really minor so the next day I was able to go, but...Some people from my class were looking weirdly at me.
I was confused, but then i reached my friends, and they gave me an annoyed look, i asked what was wrong, and they said ""Fiona told us you made her get the flu"" and i was confused, but still apologized and promised I would apologize to her as soon as she came back, the next three days i actually felt better, my friend group felt more calm without her, but still felt something missing after two months of hanging with her.
Then on Monday we had a small play performed by teachers about recycling, and i was on the last rows although I was one of the smallest of i dare say the whole class, being only 150 centimeters tall.

Then, Fiona faked falling to the floor, and cried ""OP THREW ME TO THE FLOOR"" And i was like ""No! I didn't!"" Some teachers came around, gave me a small warning, but then left me alone.
Then, after the show, i wanted to go with my friends, but I found Fiona crying with them, one said ""It was not nice of you doing that"" and didn't let me sit with them at lunch.
I thought it would be back to normal after a few days, but I was wrong, turns out Fiona started spreading rumours, she went with me to roller skating group, and i was skating kinda close to her, then, she fell to the floor, and started crying, the teacher confirmed it was not my fault, and everything continued as usual, but the next day, everyone started calling me a bully, turns out Fiona broke her wrist when she fell, and told everyone i had pushed her.
Accusations of other things continued during those years, i was left alone, nobody wanted to speak with me, i was looked down at, insulted, nobody wanted me in their group projects, and even Fiona started pushing me and cutting clips of my hair if i happened to sit in front of her.
The teachers did NOTHING.

Until, for high school, she changed schools following one of my former friends, that was the last i heard of her, and i was kinda able to clear my name, i was still alone, but at least I was just a wallflower now and not simply an outcast.

But today I was shopping for groceries, when I bumped into someone, i watched to apologise and saw her, Fiona.

I just muttered ""Sorry"" and left running to another aisle.

Honestly, i was shocked, in a bad way, i didn't really need to remember all that, i just shopped for everything I needed and left the store as quickly as I could.",non-suicide,"I bumped into my childhood Bully today.

168431,"Emotional Intelligence Survey Hello r/teenagers! I am a fellow teen doing a school project study to determine whether emotional intelligence varies between introverts and extroverts. 

For the study if you could first fill out a consent form alongside your parent/guardian to approve this study, then start the actual study by taking the introversion/extroversion survey to determine which group you fall into, then follow by taking the emotional intelligence survey. Both of them are around 30 – 40 questions long I believe, and all results for the surveys will remain anonymous to both me, and everyone else viewing the study. 

Regarding the introversion/extroversion survey it says that you will need to pay 6.00 something dollars for the full answer, however I can get everything I need from the free snapshot it gives you lmbo, to know your results 0 – 49 means introverted, and 51 – 100 is extroverted (50 is ampiverted). 

For the second survey there will be more detail in the description of the survey, but the questions will be in the form of statements, and you will answer them by ranking from 1 – 7 based on how much you agree with said statement (low being disagree, and high being agree). Of course if you have any questions, concerns, or want to leave the study just comment below and I’ll respond as soon as possible.

Thanks for the help, and I understand however if you don’t wanna participate.

I want to start by saying something that us siblings never really say to each other and that is I love you and really care about you. It seems silly that we don't say it that much but our family isn't exactly the best at talking about touchy-feely emotional stuff haha. I mean it genuinely, I still remember all the times growing up when we would play space ships in my room and I winding each other up at school by being associated with each other, and they definitely make me smile.  

The times I've seen you at Christmas I've wanted to talk to you about what has been going on to make you so sad, to do anything to try and make you feel better. But I get this feeling that it's better to pretend it isn't happening, to not bring it up, to show that what is going on doesn't change how I care about you and my little sister. There is probably an element of our family not being emotionally adept in that too. But then again it is a big important thing that can't be ignored and I feel like you might want to talk about it as you mentioned being in the hospital when we have talked.

263828,"Not sure if this is where this goes....I have never been good at any sort of small talk so I will just jump right in...lately it seems the only thing I can think of is just how awful I am, I want nothing more than to kill myself and I have been feeling this way for maybe 4-5 months now. The only reason I haven't is because I thought I needed to stick around for my wife's sake. 

Let me explain. My entire life I was raised with severe anger issues, like the kind where I broke a kids nose in 4th grade because he looked at me weird (I have a massive port-wine stain birthmark covering half my face and most of my chest.) In my adolescence I was able to somewhat get in control of it. Though it does cause many problems still. Now I am 21 years old...I should be able to handle some fucking anger. But it seems I can't. 

Throughout my life I have never had a decent work ethic. And I have always had major problems with authority. It let to me barely passing HS (I officially recieved my last 12 credits after I got my diploma thanks to a very patient HS counselor) and not being able to hold down a job. 

I can't seem to think with any emotion unless it is in the extreme. I don't feel love until it is to an almost overwhelming amount. Part of gaining control over my anger issues was to learn to ignore emotion. Now people call me ""the robot"" because emotion hardly shows any more, not until it manifests in an overwhelming amount. 

Last thing before I describe the main issue, and this is where most of you, if not all of you, will call BS and stop reading. (not even sure why I type away on this post) no-one knows the true me, not because people have not tried, but more because the inner me truly does not want anything more than to burn everything. I know it sounds stupid or like I'm just young and don't know what the hell I'm talking about but, I often describe it to myself as, ""The Beast."" Now The Beast (TB)...just imagine the most hideous, disgusting, ferocious, beast you can and you get TB. Any time anyone gets near him, he, or rather I, hurt them. I don't know if I mean to or not but in the moment, it feels so right. After the fact however, I feel a tremendous sadness. 

Now to the issue at hand. Throughout the past 4-5 months. I have noticed a recent increase in my anger, lack of work ethic, and TB showing. These have all manifested throughout my marriage and, in me doing these things, I have literally trashed mine and my wife's life 4 times and we are on the cusp of the 5th. I have brought the most beautiful wen in the world, down to 5 extremely low and hopeless points. (she already suffers from depression, diagnosed at 6 yrs) I have brought her to near suicide 5 times now...I can't seem to get the approval of my parents, let alone hers. I just don't feel like anyone truly cares for me anymore. My family only ever talks to me when they need something heavy lifted. Her family barely talks to me. And she (unfortunately) is truly the kind of person that would stay in this marriage for the sake of not having the embarrassment of divorcing me what with her super religious parents. 

Everything in my life is going downhill...again, and today for the first time ever, I actually created a plan to kill myself. I have often contemplated suicide. But I have never created a plan until today. I was in a subreddit post (don't remember which subreddit) today about different creative ways to kill myself to make it look like an accident. And someone there suggested I come here for help. I don't know what any of you can say to help me but honestly. Creating a plan today...it scared me. And reading different easy to kill myself today sacred me even more, I don't think I can be helped but I thought that it couldn't hurt anything either. And really, I am looking for help foot myself so I can maybe try to stick around for my wife. Though I'm not sure she will be around much longer either. 

For those that made it this far, thank you. And thank you in advance to any replies, if any replies come.

The people in charge don't care about us. 800,000 children go missing in the USA each year. Numbers like those have major impact on the subconscious mind.  Yes. Some of the kids are returned but most get sold into child sex slavery. Portland Oregon is the hub of child sex slavery in the United States. It also happens to have the most strip clubs in any city in the usa. This isn't a coincidence.  Oregon's own KDVR 12 covered this story. So it's not a secret.

So what's going on here? Why are we being brainwashed, kidnapped, prostituted and murdered? 
I hate it when people say children are the future, because if that's true, why is the future getting fucked from every angle?

We r told to study, go to uni and get a job. But what if we r all headed towards a dead end?  What if the systems imploding, as we speak? What if the nation's debt is so huge, that we won't be able to pay it back? What then? Do we become slaves?  Will we let that happen, will we be IMF's bitch??? Maybe that's why we r seeing so many riots and so much tension between citizens.

The point is. We r at a crossroads here in America. Let the parents and teachers try to distract us all they want using 3 hours of homework. They can't stop the reality from taking place. The toxic government is now on the brink of all out fascism, they've been committing treason against the American population for decades now, before many of us were even born, laws were put in place to cover the fascist deeds with a thin smoke screen called democracy. Now we see the orange wolf.. Trump will win this election by stealing it ofcourse. And even if Biden comes to office, it's just a different head of the same demon.

As the lockdown of fall 2020 intensifies, you'll see more and more people lose thier jobs and become unemployed, and eventually homeless. This isn't accidental, this was planned. I can prove to you that 20 years before 9/11 happened people in upper corporate management, knew it was gonna happen.

Where and how do I begin *this* one?? Why are so many of you unhappy (rightfully so) with the current education system? How do I even start to scratch the surface as to why the child suicide rate is so high in the United States? Why are kids teens and adults so unhappy in our society? Do I start from the beginning and tell you how our school system is based on centuries old schooling systems? Source: Even though we have all this technology, it doesn't matter because the whole foundation of the system is based on the Prussian school system which is OLD AF, created by, at best Facist Germany, *you cannot make this shit up!* Check the above source, it's a You. Tube link. For once you'll see something that isn't heavily censored by You. Tube. Almost all the information you get, is filtered very heavily. The true history, along with the real, universal truth is being buried. This is why we have the leaders we see today. Biden, and 300 year old pedo. And trump A 50 year old pedo. Biden's blatant child groping is so blatant that Videos of Biden touching young girls flagged as 'child sexual exploitation' by Twitter despite being official public footage Source The people in charge don't care about us. 800,000 children go missing in the USA each year. Numbers like those have major impact on the subconscious mind. Yes. Some of the kids are returned but most get sold into child sex slavery. Portland Oregon is the hub of child sex slavery in the United States. It also happens to have the most strip clubs in any city in the usa. This isn't a coincidence. Oregon's own KDVR 12 covered this story. So it's not a secret. Source So what's going on here? Why are we being brainwashed, kidnapped, prostituted and murdered? I hate it when people say children are the future, because if that's true, why is the future getting fucked from every angle? We r told to study, go to uni and get a job. But what if we r all headed towards a dead end? What if the systems imploding, as we speak? What if the nation's debt is so huge, that we won't be able to pay it back? What then? Do we become slaves? Will we let that happen, will we be IMF's bitch??? Maybe that's why we r seeing so many riots and so much tension between citizens. Source The point is. We r at a crossroads here in America.

210489,"Lost a friend to suicide years ago - keep feeling more and more overwhelmed by deathHi 

I lost a friend 3 years ago and as time as gone on I would have expected to get better but lately I feel like I just keep on feeling worse. 

I've been having suicidal thoughts for the past few years but it has been every day for the past few months. I'm far away from those I know well and love so I guess that isn't helpful but also because of the distance I have this horrible feeling that I'm gonna come back to someone being dead or someone killing themselves because I didn't ask them how they are. 

It's also not been helpful that the guy I was seeing back at home has decided he wants to take time for himself and has also stopped messaging me. As he has depression I am extremely concerned that something is up and again have these intrusive thoughts that I must check up on everyone and everyone is on the brink of killing themselves and that it's my fault but also I have to respect his boundaries and I can't explain this without putting a lot of pressure on him.

I'm also paranoid that my dying grandmother is dead and no one is telling me. I keep asking for info on how she's doing and get very little back which just makes me paint a picture that she's gone.

I've been holding myself together but it's getting all a bit much. I know nothing has happened and it all seems ridiculous and blown out of proportion but I doubt I'd still be here if it weren't for the fact that I know how it feels to have lost someone.

172723,"Problems in life and with LoveI (31M) have never been fully suicidal. I have lost a lot of people close to me from suicide or drug overdoses (as well as other things). I have however had bouts of deep depression throughout my past. Most of which were through my younger years while I was going through puberty and dealing with life in a broken household with a very dysfunctional family. I’ll spare the breakdown on my upbringing although it may contribute quite a bit to how I feel now. So let’s get into it.... 

I have been dating a girl that I met just over a year ago. Due to certain circumstances we are currently making things work long distance which is very difficult in itself. Aside from that my life took a turn when I lost someone very close to me in an unexpected horrific accident to which I stumbled upon. I have been feeling kind of lost and confused since then but have been doing my best to make do. Now me and my girlfriend love each other very much. I have had a terrible track record with love because I was a lost individual when I was younger and could not properly coexist amongst someone else so I made a bad partner and tainted the atmosphere in which I was in. My partner now is a little younger than me and does not have a lot of experience in relationships. Recently we have been having trouble in our relationship and it seems she is turning her guns on me and also pushing me away. We have talked a lot about what’s going on but she will never admit that anything she has done is wrong and she openly admits that she believes she is always right about everything. I know that is an unhealthy outlook and behavior and have told her this but she truly believes it. I myself am the type of person to step back and analyze things I have done and quickly admit my faults. The combination of the two has been causing me to dwindle down myself to a point where I have recently become so depressed that I have envisioned myself dying and being at peace because I am so distraught and hurt. I seem to be in constant emotional distress and pain. I do not plan I’m taking my life and would never do that.

I don’t know what I’m looking for in here but I feel like I’m at the end of whatever sanity and hope for life that I have had.",suicide,"Problems in life and with Love. I (31M) have never been fully suicidal. I have lost a lot of people close to me from suicide or drug overdoses (as well as other things). I have however had bouts of deep depression throughout my past. Most of which were through my younger years while I was going through puberty and dealing with life in a broken household with a very dysfunctional family. I'll spare the breakdown on my upbringing although it may contribute quite a bit to how I feel now. So let's get into it.... I have been dating a girl that I met just over a year ago. Due to certain circumstances we are currently making things work long distance which is very difficult in itself. Aside from that my life took a turn when I lost someone very close to me in an unexpected horrific accident to which I stumbled upon. I have been feeling kind of lost and confused since then but have been doing my best to make do. Now me and my girlfriend love each other very much. I have had a terrible track record with love because I was a lost individual when I was younger and could not properly coexist amongst someone else so I made a bad partner and tainted the atmosphere in which I was in. My partner now is a little younger than me and does not have a lot of experience in relationships. Recently we have been having trouble in our relationship and it seems she is turning her guns on me and also pushing me away. We have talked a lot about what's going on but she will never admit that anything she has done is wrong and she openly admits that she believes she is always right about everything. I know that is an unhealthy outlook and behavior and have told her this but she truly believes it. I myself am the type of person to step back and analyze things I have done and quickly admit my faults. The combination of the two has been causing me to dwindle down myself to a point where I have recently become so depressed that I have envisioned myself dying and being at peace because I am so distraught and hurt. I seem to be in constant emotional distress and pain. I do not plan I'm taking my life and would never do that. I just feel like this feeling I have been living with recently is exactly what people feel like the moment before they do take their own life and I am frightened, sad, and broken by this. The pain has reached an all time high and my depression has reached an all time low causing me to feel hollow but my mood now fluctuates so quickly from sad to angry that I cannot make sense of how I should feel. It is all so very uncomfortable and confusing and I feel lost at the same time.

You might think i must have been rude but it's happened so many times the i started use sir and madam in those chats as to give them respect. But still this happens

For example: once my friend offered me a online job i declined it told my other friend about it and told him why i declined the offer as it would required extra time and I'll be happy doing the stock market trading. I told him about the my plan for future stock , and just said "" wow"" and ""okay"" . No conversation ahead .

279555,"Bit of a rant I know no one is going to read this , and it sucks because that just makes me feel more helpless and speechless , like I scream ,but no on listens  

I was listening to some songs , and I just got reminded of my lonliness
I am used to hearing love songs so it wasn’t a problem 
But like this song really reminded me of a character of a book 
That I felt like really related and I just remembered how my life used to be 
I just miss that weird feeling and thrill , I miss it so dang much 
Like it wasn’t even as a gf , it was like just a friend / family member 
But it just made me feel lonley , this also made me realize that the most powerful cure for lonliness isn’t a gf , it isn’t even a friend
It’s your family , like I have a cousin , we don’t get along that well 
But she used to try to get me into her friend group 
And I think I should just go back and see if she can help me again
The thing is it feels weird , the friend group has changed 
I have changed and the best friend I had on that group isn’t there anymore 
So I feel like it just isn’t the same  and I know I don’t get along with then anymore so it’s a bit pointless 

If you read my last rant then you will remeber that I felt that everything is pointless , yeah I still feel like that , I still haven’t found a solution to all this 
Aside from waiting , and see if time brings something 

Also you may remeber I felt overwhelmed , with school
And I blame totally on myself because I am a procrastinator
But also I feel like I am trying to do 2 things at once 
I’m trying to make myself happy , and to pass school
I don’t know what to do because I have to balance it out 
When I try to to make myself happy I can’t enjoy it because I am reminded of being guilty , and when I try to do school , I lose all my motivation and everything starts feeling pointless l 
You might think that just doing both at the same time would work , but that just mixes the two bad things together l and makes me overwhelmed 

I don’t even know what should I do , I thought I was trying to make myself happy , but really I was trying both , o just wanna get a break from life 
I know that because on summer vacation is the only time where I can be happy , on the school year I just progressively go downhill with little bumps 
From my light social life . And just everything gets harder , and harder 
I just can do happily the one class I enjoy . The rest just feel horrible for  me
And I just don’t even find the motivation to keep up with them 

Man I just want a break , a break from everything , a break from me 
Maybe I just need to take a break from me , to make me feel right again",non-suicide,"Bit of a rant I know no one is going to read this , and it sucks because that just makes me feel more helpless and speechless , like I scream ,but no on listens I was listening to some songs , and I just got reminded of my lonliness I am used to hearing love songs so it wasn't a problem But like this song really reminded me of a character of a book That I felt like really related and I just remembered how my life used to be I just miss that weird feeling and thrill , I miss it so dang much Like it wasn't even as a gf , it was like just a friend / family member But it just made me feel lonley , this also made me realize that the most powerful cure for lonliness isn't a gf , it isn't even a friend It's your family , like I have a cousin , we don't get along that well But she used to try to get me into her friend group And I think I should just go back and see if she can help me again The thing is it feels weird , the friend group has changed I have changed and the best friend I had on that group isn't there anymore So I feel like it just isn't the same and I know I don't get along with then anymore so it's a bit pointless If you read my last rant then you will remeber that I felt that everything is pointless , yeah I still feel like that , I still haven't found a solution to all this Aside from waiting , and see if time brings something Also you may remeber I felt overwhelmed , with school And I blame totally on myself because I am a procrastinator But also I feel like I am trying to do 2 things at once I'm trying to make myself happy , and to pass school I don't know what to do because I have to balance it out When I try to to make myself happy I can't enjoy it because I am reminded of being guilty , and when I try to do school , I lose all my motivation and everything starts feeling pointless l You might think that just doing both at the same time would work , but that just mixes the two bad things together l and makes me overwhelmed I don't even know what should I do , I thought I was trying to make myself happy , but really I was trying both , o just wanna get a break from life I know that because on summer vacation is the only time where I can be happy , on the school year I just progressively go downhill with little bumps From my light social life .

208741,"I genuinely don’t think I’ll ever be happy.I’ve always seen my life ending with suicide. 

For a little bit of background, I was diagnosed with depression when I was 8. That was the year my parents divorced — until then, I had one alcoholic (but otherwise okay) parent and one drug addicted, abusive parent. A lot of things that I won’t go into detail about regarding my parents happened before that point and after that point.

I’ve always struggled to connect with people. I felt vulnerable as a child, so I reacted with anger when my peers tried to befriend me. They learned not to try. I switched to home school by middle school at which point I hardly ever went outside. My social skills deteriorated even more. I made good online friends, but they ultimately turned on me because I was “too annoying”. Really, I was just a lonely kid who had never been listened to before, so I guess I talked too much when we would voice chat. After that, I lost my ability to connect with people completely. It was already hard, but since this happened 8-ish years ago, I haven’t been able to maintain any relationships. I don’t even talk to my biological siblings anymore. I had three close friends, but I stopped talking to two of them over time and the other stopped talking to me. I don’t know why. I’m a distant friend, but I still try to be good to people. I got help for my anger a long time ago. These days, I’m just awkward, I guess.

To get to the point, I don’t have any friends. I was a smart kid, but my academic potential declined very suddenly when I was in high school. I tried a lot of things to help it, but nothing worked. My grades plummeted and I didn’t get into any colleges I was aiming for. I was ostracized by my work colleagues for reporting sexual harassment. Most of my family stopped talking to me because of my history of being unstable. Honestly, I don’t blame them. 

I crave normality. I want to be happy. I want good things, I aim for good things, I work hard. Admittedly, I’ve become pessimistic, but I still have this foolish hope that things will become better. I’ve been holding on like this for twelve years, writing suicide letters and coming in and out of hospitals like they’re hotels. I’ve watched myself wither away, I’ve watched the life soak back in just to leave again. I’ve also been dealing with a mentally ill mother. I’ve always had to be the parental figure for her, but most of the time it feels like I’m the only one who even cares about keeping our family afloat and our house clean. To be honest, my sense of obligation to her is the only reason I am still alive. 

I know I’m over-sharing. I know this is too long for anyone to really want to read. I guess that says a lot about me — I can’t get to the point. I ramble. I share information that hardly matters, if it matters at all. I can’t communicate well. I don’t have any friends. I don’t have a promising future. I feel lonely all the time. The only time when I feel like I’m okay is when I’m in a manic episode. 

What I’m getting at is I’m planning on killing myself. My birthday’s coming up soon, but I don’t want to live another year like this. I’m sick of my only motivation to live being the dumb hope that it’s going to get better. Maybe it does for some people. But I don’t see it ever getting better for me. It’s not that I want to die, really, but living with this this heaviness in my heart isn’t fulfilling in any way.

106555,"Okay so quick ethical dilemma First of all, I think that the idea of 'ethics' is flawed in many ways: my dad once told me ""ethics are just the result of a lack of empathy,"" and I kinda live by that, but that's besides the point. 

So first of all, I firmly believe that for every story, there's a back story: there's always two sides of the same coin, so to speak. every argument, (yes even the radical ones) because of the nature of human psychology, is true as long as the majority of people believe that it's true. The moment that 49% turns into a 51%, whatever the belief, no matter how radical, is inherently true, due to the nature of right and wrong in these kinda of political/philosophical situations: it's completely subjective. That's why, when something controversial comes up in a conversation (whether it's online or with someone I know irl) I try to keep a neutral stance.

The only problem is, I always make some dumbass assumption about the other person's argument the moment they say something. for example, if a person says they don't like trump, I would most likely assume they're also pro choice, which had never come up, and it's ridiculous that I would jump to such a presumptuous conclusion about that person. 

Emotions, because of the state of human intelligence, are obsolete and in my opinion counterproductive when trying to come to a civil conclusion with another person, or do anything intellectually challenging for that matter. Emotions aren't inherently bad, but the way they're designed evolutionary are--for lack of a better word--harmful to a modern society due to how crazy and irrational they make people.

181236,"My neighbour committed suicide and it's really messing with meAs the title says my neighbour hung herself yesterday morning. I wasn't even that close with her yet it is still hitting me pretty hard. She suffered from mental illness for years and unfortunately no one in the neighbourhood knew and to be honest, nobody was really a big fan of her. She wasn't a very nice person, she was a huge narcissist, she manipulated and used people and she never really got over her divorce that happened 20+ years ago.  

Anyways, I tried to commit suicide a few years ago and this incident is sparking flashbacks from that and I can't seem to stop ruminating on various thoughts related to that and this situation. My mom described to me in vivid detail exactly what happened (I really wish she would have spared those details) and visuals of both the scenario and my own suicide attempt keep flashing in my mind. I'm scared and I don't know what to do. 

I was home all day right across the street from her and I had no idea what was going on which chills me to the bone and makes me feel really awful. I feel horrible for her husband who came home and found her several hours deceased still hanging with the rope around her neck. I feel terrible for her kids. They had strained relationships with her and were fighting with her the day this happened. They are probably going to carry around the guilt for the rest of their lives. Her husband is more than likely going to be severely traumatized and live with PTSD and nightmares for the rest of his life. 

I feel really guilty cos my mom and I often made fun of her and ripped on her pretty hard. Fuck...if only we knew. I should have known though, I myself suffer from quite severe mental illness. I guess the lesson to be learned here is to be less of an asshole cos you never know what people are going through behind closed doors.

I want to move out of this neighbourhood now knowing the horrors that have happened right across the street plus the horrors from my own childhood that happened in this house. I don't think I'm ever going to be able to sleep soundly here again. 

Sorry for my rambling, I really needed to get this out. SW, has anything like this ever happened to you personally? If so, what have you done to cope?

I'm thinking about suicide all of time lately. I try to focus on other tasks and things but I always end up back at just killing myself. I don't know why I exist or what there even is in this world for me. I'm embarrassed of myself, I hate myself, and I think it's just time.

236143,"What do I do?I'm just going to give a synopsis: I am in my high teenage years, a bisexual male. I have a lot of friends in high school, and hold above average grades and plan on going to a prestigious university after high school. But I have been in a terrible depressive down spiral this last week or two and cannot shake the feeling.

My first issue is I think WAY too much into every little action. Of my closest friends, if any of them say pretty much anything that involves me or not, my head construes it to think of some crazy explanation proving they don't care for me. I know they do, but I can't stop putting crazy scenarios of why they could possibly dislike or resent me. This is my second group of friends in as many years, and I really do not want to keep switching around, I am very happy with these people. I just cannot shake the feeling that I annoy them/they dislike me, and my pride keeps telling me to let myself fade away. And be alone. Again.

My second problem is that of all of my friends, I have feelings for one of my closest. Another, larger problem is that he is a (presumably) straight male. I've had a million little crushes on friends, but this one is taking its time to fade away. I know that he doesn't like me (like I said, he's presumably straight) but my stupid subconscious won't let go of the idea that its a possibility. If I say anything though there is a good chance it will hurt the relationship and virtually no possibility that it could improve anything. So the last few weeks I have been walking around with that burden.

My last problem is insomnia. After a large period of time where I used to smoke often and let it help me fall asleep, I stopped. I was fine for a very long time, but the recent stress of a new group of friends and new crush has (understandably) hurt my sleep pattern. However, instead of restless sleeping at night, I have been completely unable to sleep more then 3 hours in a night for at least 3 weeks.

I don't understand. I live a blessed life, I have everything that I could need, but I desperately wish I could react much differently to situations. Never get offended, never get upset, and stay level headed instead of making crazy scenarios over minuscule details. And I wish I could be fully straight.

But I can't, and I feel like I'm running out of options.

I met a guy online and added him on snap when i was 16. He was cute and all that. But he kept asking for pictures (you know what i mean). He traumatised me. He kept forcing me into a relationship, manipulating me for more. 

My common sense snapped back eventually.  I told him a firm no. and then came the emotional blackmailing about spreading my pictures online. I blocked him, deleted snap and tried my best to forget about the fiasco.

A few months later, he contacted me on the site we met again. I blocked him there as well. He made other members on there text me to add him back and at least let him apologise. Big mistake. His apologies were a blackmail to get me back. Else, he threatened he would send screenshots of our chat on instagram to my partner who I am in a great relationship with. I didn’t want my partner to get dragged into this at the time, and with a little support and help from one of my friends, I blocked him everywhere possible.

It has been over a year to that now. There’s been no contact whatsoever. I’m happy but still so fucking worried that he might just come into my life and blackmail me. People have reassured me that nothing scary is going to happen but I am so so scared. I don’t even know what his real name and age is.

The place I was doing therapy out here can’t get me a doctor until August. I’ll be dead or hospitalized by then

For once I have some hope. These doctors really spent tine to know me. Didn’t rush me. Set up a new therapist and found a psychiatrist and made my appointments for a week and a half from now.

I'm in such crisis I need to be hospitalized but the hospital is trauma in itself. This is like a house with all sorts of therapy that they'll let me pick and choose. I'm supposed to go for 30-45 days. I'm intimidated. Overwhelmed. Scared. I can leave at anytime though. It's not an institution. 10 years of medications and bullshit. Nothing works. I am going to kill myself if I don't get help. I think this will help. I'm scared. I don't want to be separated from my service dog (yes, they are in their legal right to not allow him to stay but he's allowed to come visit) I can't stop crying. My service dog is going to think I abandoned him :loudly_crying_face: Meds got me sedated right now. My brother has all my extra meds so I can't OD again. There's a flicker of hope but I'm scared.

Also known as the ‘circumcision’ of baby boys. We condemn the circumcision of baby girls and call it FGM whereas we blatantly accept it for boys in the 21st century.

Humans rights haven’t even been established for men, women were given the right to vote and fgm was banned decades ago yet boys are being opening genitally mutilated.

Reasons:
1) circumcision is a barbaric and cruel procedure, to cut and pierce through a baby’s natural genitals with knives and scissors crosses the limits of humanity/ethics.

2) circumcision is an absolute violation of human rights and a violation of the baby’s body. They aren’t consenting to this cruel surgery which permanently alters their body for life. We talk about consent with abortion and sex, im pretty sure cutting genitals also violates their choice

3) the foreskin is a natural and fully functional part of the penis. It contains blood vessels, nerve endings and sensory neurones, circumcision decreases sensitivity and destroys the natural function of the penis.

I thought it was catchy and decided to look it up on google

Anyways, I've followed this guy on tiktok for a while. I thought he was funny, cute, and we had some things in common so he held my interest. I'm gay by the way. I don't know anything about his sexuality. I commented on most posts for the clout, and eventually he began to respond and expect my comments. Whenever he'd post one of those (you know the kind) concerning 3am tiktoks that get deleted in the morning, I would DM him and write a quick message to make sure he's alright. That was pretty much it. I didn't want anything from him, I was just bored and he's similar to me so I felt a connection. 

After some time, he began calling me by my first name in comments and dms, so I think we were friends-ish. He hosted a zoom call for his viewers and insisted that I join, even though it took me forever because my zoom was glitchy. It was the first time we'd met face to face, and he seemed really happy to see me. I was nervous, obviously, because a tiktok crush was becoming very real very fast. I mostly was on my phone because I couldn't stand the kids in the call, but had nothing else to do. Eventually he private messaged me on the zoom asking for my snapchat, which surprised me. After a few hours of the very few older people talking and laughing with/at the little kids, he claimed that he was ending the call and going to bed. Then, he booted out the kids and it was left with four girls and us two. We all stayed in the call for a few more hours, and it was pretty fun. He kept teasing me about being a simp and I admit I couldn't really defend myself that well. It was very late, and we eventually ended the call. 

Him and I starting snapchatting for while that night. He told me that he knew I was flirting with him and tried to get me to admit I was simping for him. I teased him back and eventually I admitted that I found him cute. He called me cute back. We kinda started flirting. He started asking me some questions about being gay, so I think he had recently started questioning or something similar. He asked a question that took a lot of time to answer so I asked if I could just call him. We called for a bit until I had to leave my house to watch the sunrise with my friend(regretfully). My connection faltered once I left the house, so I sent him my number and he gave me his. We called until I had to go. In retrospect I shouldn't have hung up at all. 

We snapped casually throughout the day, and he didn't respond to my attempts to conversate as much as I'd like. Everyone called again last night, but we didn't flirt or snap. It was all friendly though. I really like this guy but my feelings are all confused. I've never had an online crush actually become friends with me, much less respond as he did. But now I think that might be over, and I'm left thinking if I did something, or if things could have been better if I'd stayed on the call. (WHY didn't I do that). People aren't talking in the chat with all the people from the first zoom call, and I'm getting a little anxious. I hate that I form attachments this easily, and now I'm left being confused. 

I guess, in conclusion, I kinda fell for someone who doesn't even live near me, but who connected and flirted with me for a night. I know that's very inconsequential, but it was personal and not a quick thing. I hope. I don't want to be annoying or a bother and try to talk to him again, because that may be the case.

219165,"What do you do when both you and your parent are suicidal?This is somewhat of a re-post/follow up of a post I made on r/mentalhealth. I'm sorry for posting everywhere I'm just desperate for someone to talk to.

I want to say I'm at my rock bottom but every time I've said that in the past 6 months things have somehow gotten worse. But my depression is at the worst it's ever been. I've stopped taking care of myself, I'm withdrawing, constantly praying for death, and the worst part is I'm a burden on everyone. I know everyone says that when they're having moments of suicide ideation but this time it's true--my boyfriend broke up with me last night because he felt constantly worrying about me was hindering his personal growth, and there has been a rift between my dad and I for the last few months because I can't talk about anything but how distressed I am. 

I've inherited my dad's depression, and he is also suicidal. I know talking about these things will upset him, but I am in pain all the time and I don't know who to talk to anymore because him and my boyfriend were the last two people I felt like I had in my support system. I had a tumultuous experience with the suicide hotline last night where I was volleyed around and basically all 3 people I spoke to begged me to go to a mental health screener to receive counseling. I wasn't sure what to do; I want to get better and I know I need professional help but I didn't want to potentially be held against my will and miss work/lose my job, or be slapped with a medical bill I couldn't pay.

I talked to my dad for advice and he was just fed up. He confirmed I would lose my job and wouldn't be able to afford the apartment I'm moving into this week. He told me if I wanted to do something like this I should've done it earlier. He told me moving is a mistake and that I'm going to end up isolating myself in a new city. He told me I emotionally beat him up and have no regard for what he's going through, and then he told me he can't help me. 

He's right. He's going through so much. I shouldn't put him through all of this, but it just sits in my chest and I have no one to talk to. I'm trying to book a therapist and the suicide hotline keeps calling me to follow up, but I just want someone I love to talk to. I feel like a failure, like it's too late for me to fix anything because I have irreparably damaged every relationship I value. 

My dad told me he was a failure, and that he just wants to blow his brains out. He told me all night, ""It doesn't matter anymore."" I'm not stupid, I know what he means when he says that, because any of us here knows the context behind a sentence like that. I'm genuinely afraid, every night, that he will kill himself.

72277,"Finished my note. My family stopped caring because I already ""died"" to them. I have no earthly reason to hang on whatsoever.Hi I'm a 24 yo girl whom happens to be trans. The one bright spot in my life is my boyfriend, but we're logistically long distance until we have our finances in order. We've been dating for almost 2 years and have visited each other several times. He's the love of my life.

I've recently thought I started moving into a particular part of my life where I could finally focus on other things, rather than self conscious crap involving my image. I just finished my second plastic surgery procedure with the hopes of that improving my mental state. It has not. I beat myself up so badly effects my ability to be a socially functional human. I feel as if I'm so hideous I need to be hidden away. 

I've had a these pervasive thoughts of eventually ending my life on my terms, because I would be crushed by my own self hatred. I've always held on for family, but over the last three years they have made it clear I'm nothing to them anymore. There child has already passed in their eyes. As for my boyfriend he's to far away for me. I love him, but my family ""was"" rock for 20 years, since I was born. My dad was my best friend. He doesn't even speak to me anymore unless it's to tell me how fucked in the head I am. My ex childhood friend used me for sex and utterly toyed with my emotions. Everybody that I once knew is gone, and every other relationship that I may have in the future feels for not.

I wanted to be a makeup artist one day, but my crippling fear of judgement prevents me from taking necessary steps to achieve this. I constantly sabotage myself because I feel as if I'm always being judged.  My current job is such a slog, which is fine for money. But I feel so unaccomplished at my age. I've considered sex work because I just don't give a fuck anymore, it would pay more than I currently get. Maybe eventually giving me more money for more cosmetic surgeries, so I wont feel shitty about my mortal coil. I having a standing offer from a studio that wants me to ""model"". I feel so disgusting that my life is even this close to this. As a child I never figured I would considering basically being a whore. 

I'm so lost, I have easy access to a firearm. One shot under the ear sounds preferable to what my life has become. I don't want to become a statistic but I don't want to live another second.

So basically I gathered up a bunch of nudes From girls when I was in high school (I’m still in high school I’m a senior this year).

Anyways, I don’t even like jack off with them Or anything I just like having them cuz it’s a competition and I had to go through a fuck ton of shit for these. Also it’s like a chad move kind of you know,

My dog, age 7, is a really anxious Labrador. He’s had issues with separation and hates doors. We adopted him when he was 2, from a rescue trust.
Anyway, I have one of my chores as unloading the dishwasher, and my dog, Albie, always wants to be there. He always needs to ‘help’ or be in the middle. So, I hold up a plate or mug, and he sniffs it, and taps my wrist with his paw if it’s clean. He licks it if it’s not, and it goes back in the sink. The way he runs up to the washer whenever he hears any dishwasher open is so funny, and sometimes if it’s a completely clean load, I get a dirty bowl, rinse it, then spread peanut butter on the inside.
I taught him to do the wrist thing, before that he just backed away from the clean dish ware.
I hope this made your day a little better lol!

185054,"Putting emojis in between words does not reinforce your point, instead it makes you seem extremely arrogant and condescending. Good opinions that can be agreed upon by the community at large doesn’t need 👏 or anything of the like in between words. It makes it harder to read the entire sentence for people as it distracts them from the words they are trying to read. This may seem as a pretty boomer take, especially from a 15 yo, but it makes you seem extremely arrogant and condescending, along with seeming to be unwilling to take criticism or opinions from other people, no matter how deeply flawed their arguments are. 

The same goes for people who put “No❤️”, as it’s like a proverbial door being slammed shut in the face of a good natured (or bad natured, for that matter) discussion. It makes you come off as a person unwilling to believe they are wrong in any regard and instantly makes the person in question come off as arrogant and cocky and completely unwilling to accept the fact that their argument may just be wrong. Another instance is people putting ✨ in between the words. Once again, arrogant and cocky. 

If you have a valid and extremely good point, said emojis serve no purpose other than being obnoxious and condescending to anybody who sees it. Allow for an example (using a completely nondescript argument to not offend anybody). 

“I believe X doesn’t deserve Y”. This is a completely normal sentence without a condescending tone in it at all. They may be wrong, but they just served up their opinion for other people to dissect and form a rebuttal to.

“I 👏 believe 👏 X👏 doesn’t 👏 deserve 👏 Y”. You see where I’m coming from now? It just seems to reek of “my opinion is the only opinion that matters, and nobody can sway me of that belief”.

Here’s another using the ❤️ example in a discussion

“I think that X should do Y”

“No (or nah, or nope)”

 This seems like a pretty good starter for a rebuttal that somebody can form for their argument

“I think that X should do Y”

I thought I was doing okay.

But this past week, man....all I can think about it offing myself. I don't know what it is. It's like a repeating thought I can't get out of my head. I've been suicidal before but never attempted.

Plus the whole ""my husband always loved someone more than me and the last 15 years might have been a lie"" mindfuck.

It's such a strange feeling, because on one hand I'm curious about the future and I'm enjoying how I spend my time.

Anyway, it's midnight on a school night and I should be asleep but I'm awake typing this. My mind has been so restless for the past few months and it's getting to the point where I almost feel like I'm about to snap.

You know when you can feel yourself falling into another bad depressive episode? That sinking feeling throughout your whole body when you realize that you've got nothing to look forward to in life? Yeah. That's pretty much how I've felt 24/7 since around last October.

I dunno, I just haven't had THIS bad of a depressive episode since two years ago and I can't even go a single day anymore without thinking about new ways to commit suicide. I don't think I have the guts to follow through or anything, so don't worry about me – I just can't get it out of my head.

I keep telling myself, ""Just get through this week and you'll be okay. Get through this month and it'll be better."" The problem is that I've told myself those things every day for years. And it hasn't gotten better and I'm still not doing okay.

I've got nothing to look forward to in my life because nothing brings me pleasure anymore. I used to love listening to music but now I get no emotional response from any of my favorite songs. It's sad. It's like I'm watching everything through a screen and I feel so disconnected from my own life.

And my dog, she's one of the reasons that I'm still here right now. I love her with all my heart and she's the best dog anybody could ask for, but I find myself believing more and more each day that she would be fine without me. I know she loves me as much as I love her, but depression tells you to believe weird things, you know?

I won an academic award the other day and I could not have cared less. Younger me would have been ecstatic; current me made my mom feel so disappointed because I was too depressed to get up off my ass and go with her to the award ceremony. She was looking forward to it, and she looked so hurt when I told her that I didn't want to go. I can't even do a simple thing like that for my mom anymore.

I'm realizing now that this was all over the place. Organized thoughts are not really my strong suit.

I just feel like it's getting more and more difficult to continue on. Death seems like a welcome change.

Definitely do it in the company of adults and in a safe place. Amongst friends in a field is a very very bad idea.

Make sure you have multiple options for sleep, so that should you not be able to return home there are other options - be it a friend's house or whatever.

295726,"My younger brother in 4th grade has had 3 attempts on his life as a joke. To give context my younger brother at the time was in 3rd grade, he enjoyed playing sports and hanging out with his friends. He may of been loud and obnoxious at time but I still loved him since he was my family. My younger brother has a peanut allergy that can cause him to die if it isn’t treated in time. He’s never had any issues with this problem other than 2 times on accident when he got into peanut butter as a 4 year old. He was never really scared of his allergy and was a lot calmer around peanuts at the time. Going back to the near present he is in class during snack time when this girl around his age decided it would be hilarious to eat something that contains peanuts and touch every pencil chair and desk. My brother saw this and got scared and told a teacher. The teacher didn’t punish nor talk tot he girl and decided to clean every thing the girl touched. The next attempt which was worse was around a week later in lunch when this same girl and a few of her friends starting mocking my brother for his allergy and starting rubbing peanut butter all over his food. She started to go for his face when my brother screamed out in fear. A helper teacher went over to check out the situation to only punish my brother for screaming instead of the girls for almost killing him. When my brother got home the school called home and told my parents about him screaming. They were not happy with him until he explained why he did so. My parents then decided to email the principal furious as of to why the girls weren’t punished. They responded with some garbage that hey didn’t follow up on about talking tot he girls. After this I believe that 2 days later there was another attempt which I don’t know the details of and then relentless bullying afterwards. All the teachers decided was necessary was just talking to the whole class about be careful around people with allergies. I didn’t know how to react when hearing this especially since he was not the kid to pick on others. All he would do would probably be just talking really loud since he’s a pretty loud kid. My younger brother now has been very paranoid about any peanuts. He’ll hide as far away from you if you even go near a peanut, he also has cried a few times when more than one person has had any peanuts, along with him freaking out if his skin tone changes even the slightest thinking it’s an allergic reaction. At this point I’m trying very hard to make him be a little less scared of his allergy to the point of losing some of his social life.

41843,"My parents think I have mental problems. Because I talked in an open group chat. That's it, that's the post.

\[Edit: Please don't criticize me about Kpop. This could literally have happened with any other artist or topic and it would have ended the exact same way. I am not here to ask about your opinions on music, but for advice on the more serious issue.\]

Here's some context: I like Kpop, and I don't have many real life friends who do. My parents also happen to be big antis. They don't allow me to listen to Kpop, look at the idols, and all that whatnot. The reason being they're ""fake"" and will lead me into bad habits. But I've been pretty undercover about it, and I don't do that much anyway-- I just listen to the music. I think they've gotten somewhat used to it now, though. My parents are also very strict and guarded. I'm not allowed to go on social media much, I can't attend social events unless they're academic, I have never facetimed a friend, and I don't think I've gone out with anyone except my parents since last year. (I'm an only child.)

Last night at around 1am, I was tired, but my mind was awake. I had downloaded Kakaotalk a couple weeks ago. For those of you who don't know, it's a Korean messaging app. One feature was still new to me, the open chat, and I wanted to try it out. How it works is you can search for a topic, and join group chats with people who like the same topic. My favorite Kpop group Stray Kids had just come back recently with a new album, so I thought it would be interesting to talk with some other people about it. So I searched up Stray Kids, and joined in a room with a couple hundred people. I don't really know how the culture is like in these chats, but being a new person I introduced myself (said my name, but that's it) and said my bias in the group. Then some people welcomed me so I chatted with them for a bit. It was only a few texts, about nothing in particular. Then I got sleepy so I said I have to go. And fell asleep.  
Today I was attending a class via Zoom and heard my parents discussing downstairs. They said ""she needs a therapist"" and I was curious who they were talking about, so I asked. It was me.My mom came running into my room and throwing insults at me. Said I need a therapist and I was being controlled by Satan (mind you, we are a Christian family). She proceeds to say that if I can't sleep at night, I should do my homework. And both of them yell at me for the remainder of my class. The bad thing is, we're required to turn our videos on for Zoom. So I had to slouch in my chair the whole time and only show my forehead because I was crying.There's actually some more but I would have to give too much context, and I'm not really in the mood to write a whole novel right now.

But I really need to know. Is this really a valid reason to say I'm mentally damaged and need help? Because I am 99.99% certain I am not. I've made online friends before, on Discord. I am completely familiar with the Discord Kpop community, and reveal a limited part of my identity. I know the risks, and I know how to take care of myself. Plus, Kakaotalk has complete anonymity in the open group chats, so they can't see anything except my name and picture (which was a pic of me without my face. nothing revealing).

I don't know what I'm asking for writing this post, probably just validation, but I want to know that I'm not the only one who thinks I didn't do anything wrong. Yes, it was against my parents' standards, but do I really have to go see a therapist now???

I've been programmed all my life to not express myself -- that the world doesn't care if you're sad, that no one cares about your problems.  I've been trying to reach out, because the self-help web pages say that's best, because my past shrinks had suggested so, because I know that I'm so fucking lonely I could die.  But it never works.  My problems are too big, too serious.   Or something.  It's okay, though.  I knew this would happen.  I'm too crazy so I'll just stay in my personal loony bin of an apartment and do myself in.

There's a part of me that thinks this isn't fair, though.  Everyone should have friends, or someone that cares about them.  Substantive human connection.  Someone that will stick with them, no matter what might happen.  I am not sure if I had that, ever, really.  I would like to one day, but I think it's impossible because I'm a cuckoo.

Now, I know that I'm going to do it.  I have my means lined up around me at this second and a backup plan if they don't work.  I'm really scared of failure, because I don't want to deal with the aftermath -- and face the fact that I'm fucking alone with no one who fucking cares enough.  

This is a purely selfish gesture of me, however.  I hate myself so much; I've hated myself for so, so long so I don't believe anything will change my fundamental way of thinking but even if it's from strangers on the Internet, I've some things I kinda want to hear, because no one in my real life ever offers these words unless it's someone I've paid to sit on a couch.

Things like ""you absolutely deserved unconditional love as a child"", or ""having to see and deal with the things you did was really rough"".  ""Those people shouldn't have run out on you.""  ""You deserved a friend during that time.""  ""Being lied to like that was unacceptable.""  ""If you said no, and someone does that, it's not your fault.""

I want to hear that I tried so hard through all these things, but it's okay.  You did a good job; you worked so hard even though things didn't quite work out.  Because I tried really hard, guys.  But I can't do this anymore.  I have this really infantile desire to be held and pet on the head, so feel safe and loved with someone enough to cry because it's hurt so bad for so long.

22913,"Sinking FeelingMy girlfriend left me. 

I'd always felt like a waste. I had gotten expelled back in middle school and that's when I first tried to take my own life. I couldn't swallow pills easily and ended up not taking anywhere near enough to hurt myself. I wailed and smacked my head against the floor which finally made me unconscious. No one knew, except my brother who had found the note I left. A page of scrabbling I shoved under the couch I wanted to die on.

Highschool was an odd time. I'd spent most of it eating lunch alone in the stairwells. I was a horrible student with no motivation. Every week I wanted to just die. I got arrested while being a menace with my only friend. His parents forbade him from seeing me, and I became truly alone.

I tried breaking out, joined the schools football and rugby team. I went from being denied in my freshman year to starter in senior and junior. I don't talk to anyone on those teams anymore. I never went to the parties, and except for an athletic award, there's no way for me to remember those years. No one ever took a picture of me.My parents never came to game. 

I became cynical. I faked who I was and played the cool cat. Feel into drugs. Drove drunk and high more times than I care to admit. I'd drive my fathers motorcycle at near 200km/h on hilly roads out in the countryside, with  no regard for myself or others. I'd sometimes close my eyes and hope that I'd be veering off course. I couldn't do it.

I'd break down crying pretty often. Just randomly while doing things. I couldn't explain it. Sometimes I'd look in the mirror and notice myself frowning intensely and tearing up. It hurt in a way I can't describe and couldn't feel. 

University rolled around. I was getting high everyday, or every other day. I failed out of my program after the first semester. 

Ah, this is all side garbage. My current girlfriend, or ex.. she was introduced to me through a friend. She'd have him up in her room, late at night. Her floormates would tease her about locked her door all the time. That friend told me they'd bang.

I'd begun to lose weight. I went from 235 to my current 170 over these past few year. I'd think love from someone would mean something. She yelled at him publically, telling me, who she confided in, (she actually had never once asked me about my life, or how I was feeling. She just used me to talk to and get to him)

(Btw sorry if i make any spelling errors, my giant fingers prevent me from typing properly) here in singapore, they government doesnt really tolerate racism, like in our nation's pledge theres  stuff abt equality. A lot of racism or hurtful talk abt my being american occurs at school usually. Im allowed to go to local schools cus im part singaporean, so most of my classmates are singaporeans.

So there are a few cases where ive been hated on cus im half american. (Im obviously not gonna include jokes, those are just poking fun we do that sometimes)

So the time i hated this the most was when a classmate in primary school came up with a lie abt some american he met while playing minecraft and tried to link it to me, which he did successfully somehow (idk lol my classmates were idiots). Anyways, he claimed there was a guy he met while playing minecraft who was being racist and specifically saying, ""I HATE SINGAPOREANS THEY ARE THE WORST. ALSO IM AMERICAN"". Like im not joking, thats literally what my classmate claimed the guy he met online said. Im not denying that it was true, but really thats just way too specific. But moving on, that somehiw managed to get most of the class angry at me cus ""all americans are racist"" like dude. First of all, that was an obvious lie.
Second, even if it wasnt, i was in no way connected to that guy and its unfair for people to draw the conclusion that i was a racist.

Ok so this is a more general kind of disrespect: stereotypes. Ik that every country has a stereotype nobody likes, and people sometimes use them jokingly, but idc if its a joke, stereotypes shoudlnt be followed. As an asian american, i typically get taunted with ""asians are smart"" and ""americans are fat asses"" stereotypes. For the fat one, as someone who is EXTREMELY concious about my looks and body, i found it offensive that i have to live almost everyday at school getting called fat. I have told my classmates, the main source of this bullying, to knock it off, but every morning when i get to school im hit with about 50 of them. Personally, the smart stereotypes dont bother me too much, but there have been times when i just felt horrible because of them. Im not the sharpest tool in the shed and often dont do well in my exams, so whenever i tell anyone who isnt a fellow singaporean about my results, i get screamed at cause ""asians are supposed to be smart af and always do well"". IF IM NOT DOING WELL DONT EXPECT ME TO DO BETTER BY YELLING AT ME TO BE SMART LIKE MY FELLOW ASIANS. IT DOESNT HELP YOU GOD DAMN IDIOTS.

I dont mean to drive attention away from anti-black racism (racism against black people), but i feel like as someone who has been hated on cus of what i look like, i wanted to talk abt this and reinforce the idea that any racism at all is horrible and shouldnt go on

127023,"Am I a sociopath?be honestOk, so here is the story. One year and a half ago I was diagnosed with Harm OCD. Ok, so there was a reason I had these thoughts, so I forget about them. But a few months ago they started bugging me again. I just couldn’t let something go. I started worrying again, that I was sociopath or psychopath. I always assumed I was since I have guilt and feel shame and so on. But wait, what if I don’t feel those things, just fear what would say about me(narcassistic). Also sociopaths can feel some meassure of guilt and shame after they’ve done something bad. Also empathy, I read on the ASPD forum that they can actually feel empathy(selective empathy), because they compare how they would feel, but no sypathy(they’re just guessing). I figured thats kinda what I do, I first am emotionless, but I feel bad when I think about it little. Also I’m a vegan(no animal products what so ever), but sometimes I forget why and have to think to again feel empathy for animals. In these few months I figured I had some sort of superiority complex, but shock after shock I realized I was really stupid and I try to fix that. I don’t look for problems in others but in myself, also I try not feel like achieved something for little things or feel special, also try not to see things as black&amp;white(sometimes I would feel very irretated with my classmates and feel for eq. “At least I’m smarter than them”, which ofc I’m not, and then again see them in a bright light after they’ve been nice to me). Now every time I feel superior I imidiatly feel guilty and a shammed. And this. One year ago we had a pet cameleon. And then we have to gave it away, because we could’t provide for him any longer. But before that I torchered him once. I flipped him in the air and grabbed his foot an kept him in the air for couple of seconds(I only did this once, but flipped him in the air couple of times). I really didn’t think about it, but never did that again, and was on the verge of crying because feeling really guilty and asshamed. You can’t believe how happy I was for him when we gave him away to a better home. I never did this to any animal before and after, but till this day I can’t forget about it. I feel anxious, have to take deep breathes, guilt(again is this really guilt, or just shamme because of my ego?!) and I can’t move on. When i’m manic(I use to be manic about stupid stuff, but now I get when I think of more simple wife- job, having basic stuff, like food and apartment and some luxury, and when I get this, I feel stupid for having those thoughts and feel like I will be able to move on.) i try to move on and forget about the whole thing(everything), and I succedd for this short time and feel very stupid for having those thought, but then again after I start thinking can’t stop.

So, If im a psychopath or sociopath I want to kill myself, I couldn’t do it before because of my mom(am I feeling guilty because of her, or do I look at her with pitty and feel bad because of that?!), but if her son was Jeff Dahmer, she’d want him dead.

There's also the fear of how I will appear to other people once my genitals are gone. I really don't want people around me thinking I'm a freak because I don't have genitals or because I removed them willingly.

190346,"Well r/teenagers, it’s been a fun ride. After today I will officially be 20 years old. To celebrate the milestone, here’s 20 bits of advice I wish I had when I had just become a teenager (turning 13) 
1. Being a teenager is hard as fuck; you find yourself in a state of flux where almost nobody will relate at all to you, whether they’re young or old. *This is okay.*

2. It’s gonna take a while for you to find who you really are. You probably won’t start settling on a solid persona until you hit 16-18.

3. What seems permanent right now is most likely just a phase, even though you said how much it really is you forever now.

4. That doesn’t mean resist what you want to do because it’s just a phase. Embrace the weird stuff. Listen to death metal. Watch anime. Paint your nails. Wear crazy neon colors that don’t match. Do it. And take lots of pictures when you do. It’ll be hilarious later.

5. Talk to your crush. Ask her out. It’s okay to be nervous, just don’t be weird.

6. It helps if you get to know her as a person a little bit before making your move, and at least make it *seem* like you have a sense of self-respect. Clean up after yourself, look/smell clean, and for fuck’s sake, don’t seem like you’re desperate.

7. **Make some goddamn friends.** It absolutely sucks to look back on most of your high school experience and realize that all you did was play video games, watch anime, and jerk off the entire time. All that will do is make you feel depressed and worthless. (You’re still gonna feel that way regardless, but at least you’ll have someone to talk about it with)

8. Find some people that you can relate to. If you’re a nerd who likes to talk about anime, science, and video games, try talking to the quiet kid or something.

9. Sit in the *back of every fucking class*. If you’re lucky you can snack, use your phone, and draw dicks on the table all year without the teacher noticing.

10. In a few years. you’re either gonna find a lot of formerly cool shit right to be cringy as fuck, or you’re going to *be* cringy as fuck. Try to be the first one.

11. Learn to laugh at your cringeworthy moments, and learn from your true mistakes.

12. Talk to the janitor. Learn his/her name. Use it.

13. Talk to the security guards. Find out which ones are the cool ones. Trust me, I’ve gotten out of *so much shit* just because I had a security guard cover my ass.

14. Join clubs. If you don’t like them, don’t go, but at least try a few and see if you can get involved. Same goes with after-school activities.

15. If you’re gonna fuck, **get some fucking protection.**

16. If you’re gonna smoke weed, **get some fucking snacks, and do it with people that you like.**

17. If you’re not primarily focused on academics, getting a part-time job to earn some cash is literally one of the best things you can do while still in school.

18. That doesn’t mean “get all ‘C’s and work at McDonalds”. Your academics are important and your performance in school should be a priority.

19. Getting a license and a car is **SO FUCKING WORTH IT.** Your world opens up like ten times over when you suddenly have the capability to drive anywhere you want to go. If you’re the guy/girl with a ride, it’s super easy to cement yourself as the “pack leader” for your friend group. Plus it’s going to set you up for success after you graduate.

20. More than anything, live life how you really want, on your terms. Don’t bottle yourself up and hide who you really are. You’re a special, one-of-a-kind human being and there won’t ever be another person like you ever again. You are made up of the essence of a thousand dying stars, and you have that same power to light up the world with what potential you have. Use it wisely.

I’m a big and I relate more with the normie girls, so to me it usually seems like it’s showing how girls are normal and boys are over the top and stupid, which is kinda funny. I think it’s kinda stupid that some people see it as “boys cool and quirky, girls boring and lame”, it just seems like an silly overrreaction.

305178,"My Bro Is a Simp Okay, so basically, my bro gets a girlfriend. Congratulations, right? But no, it's bad, really bad.

Due to some 'reasons', that girlfriend of his somehow have to play games with him, at midnight, 2 am to 4 am, sometimes 10 pm a.d more.

Playing games is fine, he plays all the time, the f ing problem is that he speaks to his girlfriend. You see, I don't have rooms and walls to separate the house, we basically live in one big room, so I just have to listen to his fucking flirts and fake giggles keep swirling around my ducking head.

I'm 16, I have exams and crap to do, logically, I need well sleeps, but NO, EVERY DAY, I got woken up by his stupid ass noises. My dark circles is so deep my teacher is literally asking me on lesson "" Are you okay?""

That's not really the worst, the worst is he's older than me, a 19 or 20 years old adult, he needs to wake up at 5/6 every morning to work, but oh no, he didn't sleep, he decides to pull all-nighter just so he can speaks to his girlfriend... I don't remember girlfriend is more important than work???

That's not actually simping... So I'll get a better example. There's that one week, I have to get some dumb stuff and pay them myself, during online lessons, RIGHT BEFORE exams, 2 DAYS in a god damn roll, they cost like 500 and more. Those things are ALL for his girlfriend. Man, not even mom get shit from him. Also, he had two girlfriends before this one, they are similar, asking for gifts and everything, I remember he bought a game, an entire cosplay collection and more, just outright expensive... Despite the previous two heartbreak and literally so much money wasted, he still buy shit for that lady that he barely meets irl...

Lastly... That idiot bro praises her all the time. "" I'll never leave you, silly."" "" Sweet baby"" Blah blah blah, simply remembering it gives me a headache, and he dares call her "" MATURE"" in front of my ducking face. We are at the same age, I don't stay up except for homework, or there's no need to wake up early tomorrow, I know when to stop play phone, I know school is important. That girlfriend fucking literally stay up until almost morning to play games? That's mature??? What about your fucking school grade lady??? Mature your f ing ass, I bet my soul that ALL my school grade are all above her lazy, immature ass grade that's probably all the way down to bedrock... I mean, seriously, you stay up until 4 am and you are bonding a relationship with someone, how the fuck can you keep up with your grades like that?

Anyway that's it. It was supposed to be short complain that I haven't get any good quality sleep ever since he gets a girl but turns out my entire 5 months of holding back have much more anger and hatred that I expected... I tried asmr, I tried using ear plugs, fuck, nothing work.

I’ve been thinking about suicide way too much. I don’t think I’m depressed and I don’t want to claim to be. I’m well aware there are many many people that are suffering way more than me, but the thought just never leaves my mind. I don’t think I’ll ever do it but it does affect me negatively. I tend to feel really guilty about it because it makes me feel like I’m ungrateful for the life I have. I live in a good home and my parents are really good to me most of the time at least, I have really close friends I could count on so I don’t know why I’m like this.
I’m 17, and I’ve been having these thoughts ever since I was 9. In the past, it was a more serious thing, as I wouldn’t only consider it but I would do things like kind of pull my leg over a window or hold a knife in my hand and point it to myself before realizing “I don’t actually want to do this” and stop.

Rbf, my life was trash as a kid so it’s understandable I guess but as the years went on, I got better. My life has changed a lot and I became stronger and happier. 
Now I try my best to be a positive person. But these thoughts just never leave my mind. On worse days I would stand near the metro train tracks and have to walk back a little just because they look so tempting to jump out in front of. 
I know I’m not going to do it. I’ve recently become more religious and I wouldn’t want to scar the people I care about, though that’s been more difficult as those people recently seriously shrunk in number and there weren’t that many to begin with.
I don’t know what the future is going to look like, I don’t know how these thoughts will develop.  I’m fine for now at least.
I can’t go see a doctor because my parents wouldn’t believe there’s something wrong with me, so I can’t be exactly sure why I’m having these thoughts so often. Maybe it’s a result of exhaustion? Lack of sleep possibly? It does tend to occur on more stressful days.

I dont have the motivation to study and frankly i consider it a waste of time. My grades are terrible and im constantly disappointing my parents which just makes it all so much worse. 

No real friend up to this point. Everyone i felt a connection to either brushes me away,or straight up dismisses me with obvious lies. I always feel like i am not wanted by anyone except my brother and my mom. I rarely ever spend any time with dad since he and my mom are divorced and we get to see eachother every 2 weeks or longer. 

I do not yet know what i want to do with my life. Im in highschool,10th grade,and as i said my grades are miserable. I aced my graduation exam from regular school to high school,getting an average grade of 9.50,but from then on i just havent found the motivation to study further.  

Its like life has me pinned down like a bad guy from an action movie and i just keep getting punched in the face,every day. I never did any harm to anyone. I ever only got in 2 fights overall in my life and those consisted in just 2 punches total. I just want everyone to be pleased and i want everyone happy. 

I think too much and i end up getting myself even more depressed. I listen to sad music imagining myself writing down my suicide note and imagining how everyone would react to it and what i would write to best describe my feelings. 

Earlier i paired ""bullying"" with ""listening to other peoples problems"" in the same sentence,i am sure you must be confused. Well at my school almost everyone seems to be self-centered,hypocritical,very un-empathetic and just assholes overall. One minute they bully me then they want me to listen to their problems. 

I have never,ever recieved any form of support from anybody in my entire life throughout. I am always alone with fighting this depression and i dont have anyone who i can trust or who would understand. 

Also going to a therapist is out of the question,i consider them to view everything from a ""scientific"" standpoint if that makes any sense,i do not imagine them taking into account the human element of it all,how i just cant go on without breaking.

I am not afraid of death. I would do anything to get out of this hell but i do think that...suicide is not an option,i dont want to hurt my family or anyone who i might have missed that cares about me even a small bit.

124651,"Tomorrow, I shall attempt reaching freedom.It took a lot of convincing to myself and courage to post this, but here it goes.

I can't take the torment anymore. Not only have I been dealing with mental illnesses for years, but my mother has damaged me further, and my dad left me behind to soak in my mother's nearly-constant rage. A few years ago, after I started seeing therapy for my parents fighting, I was diagnosed with an array of illnesses: panic disorder, anxiety, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. Soon after that, my dad couldn't take the fighting anymore, so he left my twin and I with my mother to live somewhere else. My mother was and still is mad at him for leaving us behind without financial support, so she has and still is letting her fury out on me.

I'm scared to live. I haven't had a decent day in a long time. I can't go a day without auditory hallucinations/panic attacks and/or getting yelled at or sometimes even hit. I have attempted suicide twice in the past - both were overdoses. The first time, I was hardly affected. The second time... close, but no cigar. I hadn't attempted suicide since two years ago. I thank my best friend of two years managing to give me a reason to live... it's a shame we hardly contact each other anymore. I miss him so much... almost as much as my dad. Thankfully, I'll get to see my dad one last time tomorrow, for his birthday. I say it's my last time, as I plan to attempt suicide the same way I tried the two other times. 

If I manage to succeed, well... I guess my mother will be finally happy to not have a waste of space around anymore, bothering her with each inch of her life. And my sister, she won't have to worry about me ruining her plans with my panic attacks. And, for my dad... at least he'll be happy that I won't have to be around mother anymore, I guess. I hope my best friend won't miss me too much - by how he is, I won't doubt it that he'll heal from it quickly.

If I don't succeed, I hope I don't get thrown away into a hospital like last time. Being at that hospital made me worse - I gained my habit of staying up for several nights on end there. Everyone scared me there, and I am traumatized from that event. I have vivid nightmares almost every night of that horrid place. If I don't succeed, I don't want to go back into that hellhole of a school.

28970,"I Dislike My Mother/family/life situation Covid-19. I hate it. My mother is fucking afraid of it. If I go out in public, I have to be quarantined in the basement for two weeks. I'm fine with this, I don't like interacting with my family anyways. Recently, dance classes started again. I'm doing all virtual, while other people are going into the studio and wearing masks, etc. I love dancing, it's sm fun and just dancing is so idk there isnt enough words. I was supposed to start pointe last year, but I had an ankle injury, so my class started while I either watched in the corner (couldn't dance the first few weeks), and then just continued class on flats. It was rather depressing. 

This year, corona decides to fucking exist. And of course, my mom hates it. I would be able to start pointe this year, except i can't go to the studio for a pointe evaluation because my fucking mom. and even if i did, i would have to practice at the studio so I learn everything properly. My mom doesn't like that. She won't drive me. I can't carpool with anyone because my carpool buddy stopped dancing. The only choice I have for my dad to drive me. 

My dad is a buisnessman, and he's always traveling back and forth from the US to china, and occasionally other countries to make deals. He spent a good chunk of time (January-June) in the US, when corona started he came back from china. He left Mid June, and he's going to come back at the end of the year. 

I'm not very close with him, he's always traveling. He gets mad at me when I fail to do things, such as having bad grades. He's rather violent, so I'd rather not get into that. It's not really abuse, the last time anything happened was in march, when my grades were shit. I just got a nosebleed due to slapping and afterwards he started being ""mr. nice guy"". 

December will be too late to start pointe, everyone will be ahead of me and already knowing shit. I practice pretty often, I'd like to say I'm decent at ballet. On saturdays, we have technique class. I'm in ""senior technique"" which is basically the older kids. Since we're the last people to be in the studio on saturdays, it's empty. My studio decided to split the class between three dance rooms, so that everyone can come to the studio. 

My mom knows about this, but i'm still stuck at home. I'm a rather independent person, so I enjoy my space. However, I'm the only person who's doing virtual for technique, everyone else is at the studio.  I guess you could say I have a rather low self confidence when it comes to ""not fitting in"" such as me being the only person on zoom. I can't dance properly at home, I have enough space and a barre and a yoga mat and my shit ton of shoes, but my flooring hurts. My mom could buy it, but she won't. I don't think she understands what a difference it can make. My feet hurt when i jump, and it's either too slippery or too grabby. 

I'm a fucking sensitive person. I cry too damn much. I shut out so many people, and i just leave them on ""opened"". My mother takes away my phone when my grades are shit, so I only had my phone for the first week of school. My wifi time is from 8am -8:30pm. my school starts 9pm-3pm. I have one hour  until my dance classes, which go from 5:15pm to around 7:30(MTW), and speech class on thursdays from 7-8pm. I'm a lazy procrastinator. I can get some of my work done if I motivate myself enough but sometimes I want to talk to someone, to interact yk? and i get distracted easily. 

I want to have a good future, and i'm constantly thinking about being successful doing who knows what. My mother also takes away any devices when she sees im ""off task, playing games, talking to someone, "" or whatever that shit is. As a result, I can't do my work. She also takes away devices when my room is a mess, I act up, I don't listen to her, I don't watch my little brother, or whatever reason.  

I'm not suicidial i just wish that I could be happy yk? I want to be back at when i was five, going to the mall for dinner and returning home when the mall closed, feeling sleepy and happy. Playing in that kiddie area with those climbable things that were hard but squishy, I dont know how to describe it. Going on road trips to a destination my younger self was too excited and dumb to understand. 

I can tell when someone likes me. I don't know how to describe it, i just know it. They don't really know what I'm like though, just what I allow them to see. maybe three-ish of them stalk me, so ig they'll read this. who cares? I dont. I don't want to lead them on or something, I feel bad that I might be doing that, and it hurts me. They don't say anything, so i can't say anything. Id prefer if they just said ""i don't like you, yk"" or something so that way i can be sure I'm not going to hurt them. I just genuinely want someone to be friends with. I have friends that I'm close with, but they don't understand my shit. 

They know about grades, ""screen time"" and that basic stuff, but I don't let them see me cry and all that deeper shit. Probably because I don't have my phone to tell them, so they've probably think I've ghosted them. It's happened before, so i hope they'll know that my mother took away my phone, but I don't really care. I can talk to them on the spot when i need to. 

My family gets angry when I don't do things their way or as soon as they want me to. For example "" go wash the dishes"" I'll say ok, and just chill for a minute. In my mind, Im planning to wash the dishes in 5 minutes. I just want to chill for a while. If I don't get up as soon as they say so, they get mad. it's always pulling on something to get me up(ex. clothes, hair, ear, etc).  I hate this, i don't like being controlled or asked to do things someone else's way. 

shouting. i hate it. I just hate when someone shouts at me. Not only do I feel angry, i feel like i'm dissapointing them and i feel guilty and angry at the same time. It's hard to explain.

The way he handles stress is by fighting people and since he’s mad at me he’s probably gonna try to fight me. If you guys have any tips on how I can protect myself I’d be pretty happy. Now for the back story... I started dating this girl (we’ll call her Rose) in March. She was absolutely perfect in every way.

She said she really really loves me as a friend and she was scared that if she did break up with me soon we might ruin our relationship and she was terrified of that. We ended up being great friends again. A few weeks later, one of my friends, one of the boys (we’ll call him Dave), started dating her. I was kinda mad at him for breaking bro code but as long as Rose was happy I was fine with it. A few weeks later, Dave texted me. He said “do you want her?” Immediately I was a bit on edge cuz he made it sound like he thought of her as an object. I told him that I wasn’t sure cuz I love her but I love her a lot more as a friend. Then he said “we’ll she’s not talking to me, so if you want her you can have her.” I was really confused here because, WHY THE HELL WHOULD ANYONE WANT TO TELL ANOTHER GUY TO HAVE THEIR GF.

I showed her a screenshot of the texts he sent me, and after talking to him about it for a while she broke up with him.

Life is more than that. In forgiveness, you aren't at fault. It may be your life, but you're only the one who is living it. In forgiveness, you are free from bondage. Love is the prevailing force behind it. So please, what I ask of you is to forgive yourself because *you can*. You can love yourself. You can go further. You are forgiven and I love you. :heart_suit:",non-suicide,0.56469226,0.23554206,0.11040868,0.6301823,0.47327563

There’s so much emotional pain in my heart and mind and the physical agony I’m in is too much.

J, I know you’re gonna find this when you go through my phone. You’ve seen me go through all of this bullshit, and today when I said I felt like going to get a gun you told me you were going swimming with our son. 

I get it. You’re tired of dealing with me. I don’t blame you.

I can’t do this anymore. I can’t feel this much pain from so much trauma and I can’t handle this spine injury and I cannot deal with knowing that his life is hopeless.

I talk a good talk at suicide bereavement group. I help “guide” those as I grieve for my cousin. I tried. I tried and I’m giving up.

I know you’re gonna see this. I burned all the notes for the kids and my family and you awhile back when hope was alive. Sorry but you guys just have to understand that this is hell and I can’t do it anymore. I love you, kids.

Tomorrow morning when you leave for work and school I’m going to drive....ha, drive; I hope the adrenaline gets me there bc I don’t know how the fuck I’m going to drive with these discs bulging. 
I’m going to that gun range. I’m going to act the part of charming girl who just wants to feel safe in this big bad world.
I know you know how good I am with people. They won’t question me. I’ll have that gun in my hands and once someone teaches me how to use it, once it’s me and the target....I’m gone.

At least you won’t have to clean up brain matter and jaw bones and teeth like I did. Sorry for the ones who will.

I’ve tried. I can’t do this. It hurts too much.  The pain outweighs everything now.

First. My love to all of you out there. I am in a bad place, but I see that so many of us are.

Im 27 male. Ive been diagnosed with a slew of things over the years. Chronic pain since age 15. Divorced parents, seen over a dozen psychs since then and countless doctors.
At ages 12, 16, 17, 19 I tried committing suicide.

I am on medicine that has ""helped"". But I contemplate suicide daily. Hourly.
Depressed, lonely, dejected. Tired! So tired.
Tired of talking it out, tired of explaining myself, rationalizing, trying to make people understand.

Tired of waiting for someone, anyone to see the pain I'm in and offer help...

---

Here's the thing. I just found this sub. I am absolutely dumbfounded by the number of posts on here that resemble parts of what I just wrote.

My friends and family can't understand what I'm feeling. But reading 10 posts and I feel like all of us are kindred spirits.

What is wrong here?
I have and still do feel ashamed of my thoughts. I have to explain away my bpd. We all hide this away behind masks. Telling people, oh I'm great, thanks for asking. How are you?

We're wrong for being so selfish to even consider suicide.
Screw that!
Anyone that says suicide is selfish is fundamentally wrong. Suicide isn't about that. Suicide is about pain. And hurting so much that there is no way out.

---

So why are you here? What is wrong that we feel like we need to hide behind anonymity, and vent our problems, our cries for help to strangers?

There are commercials about suicide prevention. I have sat and watched them with loved ones, and all are totally oblivious that I'm thinking about shooting myself right that very second.

There are groups, and call centers (I've had bad luck with those) but... Have they helped you?

There is something so wrong here. What needs to change? What do we need? What needs to happen?

I will pledge myself right now. What do we need to implement change? What is wrong with what is being done currently?",suicide,"What is wrong with this picture??Not even using an alt for this. First. My love to all of you out there. I am in a bad place, but I see that so many of us are. Im 27 male. Ive been diagnosed with a slew of things over the years. Chronic pain since age 15. Divorced parents, seen over a dozen psychs since then and countless doctors. At ages 12, 16, 17, 19 I tried committing suicide. I am on medicine that has ""helped"". But I contemplate suicide daily. Hourly. Depressed, lonely, dejected. Tired! So tired. Tired of talking it out, tired of explaining myself, rationalizing, trying to make people understand. Tired of waiting for someone, anyone to see the pain I'm in and offer help... --- Here's the thing. I just found this sub. I am absolutely dumbfounded by the number of posts on here that resemble parts of what I just wrote. My friends and family can't understand what I'm feeling. But reading 10 posts and I feel like all of us are kindred spirits. What is wrong here? I have and still do feel ashamed of my thoughts. I have to explain away my bpd. We all hide this away behind masks. Telling people, oh I'm great, thanks for asking. How are you? We're wrong for being so selfish to even consider suicide. Screw that! Anyone that says suicide is selfish is fundamentally wrong. Suicide isn't about that. Suicide is about pain. And hurting so much that there is no way out. --- So why are you here?

So these short sellers saw that Gamestop stock prices might fall, which is good for them. It’s good because they borrow gamestop stock from people, then sell them, and when the price drops they buy back stock and effectively gain money.

So some degenerates at r/wallstreetbets saw this. Do you know what they did? Spammed the fuck out of gamestop stock making it increase by over 3000%. Now these short sellers who already sold stock got fucked in the ass because they had to buy back the stock they borrowed to return it to the lender, and since it was like 12$ when they bought it and 350$ now, say they borrow 300 stock, they lost multiple thousands of dollars.

Although r/wallstreetbets did this, multiple people bought stock early and kept it. Since the value of the gamestop stock then raised so drastically, many of them easily brought in hundreds of thousands of dollars, and made short sellers and entire corporations lose multiple billion dollars.

The people that got this money then were able to pay for their tuition, donate it, pay for their family member’s surgery, just great stuff.

This is my first post in this sub. I'm quite new to reddit so please excuse me if I make etiquette mistakes.

I've been severely depressed for the past 3/4 years. I'm not sure I'm ready to go into the details in public. I talked about it with a therapists (CBT) but didn't help much. My friends are too selfish to actually give a damn and they only lean on me when they need something.
What makes me even more depressed is that I don't have any serious reason to be so down. I have two kids, a good job (actually a dream job for million of people), but I don't love my wife anymore and I feel completely empty inside.
I've always been very sensitive and now I feel... Exhausted. Everything throws me over the edge and something that happens yesterday left me in a terrible state. I couldn't get out of bed the all day and only now I've been able to pick up my tablet to write this post.

I crave love. I need love.

I've always been drawn to the star crossed love stories and in fact the one with my wife started that way: impossible, intense and cursed.
We made it worked, got married and then.... It basically finished.

I'm 40 and I feel my life slipping away. I don't see any future and I'm not killing myself only because of my kids.
There is.... Someone.... Another star crossed love story... She makes my hearth beat again... but I can't have her... No matter how much I think about it there is no solution.
I live in London and the tube trains are starting to look very... appealing. They seem to be the easiest solution.

I live in the UK, so the doctors wont do anything and the mental health treatment is pretty much non existent, I haven't even been diagnosed because they don't care at all.

**but it gets worse**

My brother and sister never attempt to talk to me, I am an outcast, and I am pretty sure that they actually believe that I have severe autism or am retarded in some way, this is because they have never seen me speak to my own friends and strangers in a normal way (and it would kill me inside if they do, thats how SM works).

My mum cares about me, but doesn't realise the full extent, she has recently tried to help me by 'talking to me more like an adult', thanks.. I guess.. I mean I am 16 so it's about time. It doesn't help at all though, she doesn't understand my situation.

Can you imagine being silent inside your own house, being scared to talk around your OWN family, for 16 years and counting!? Just imagine, not being able to have a conversation with any of your family members, it's essentially like being an orphan, but worse in my opinion. Why? 

I cannot have friends over. They cannot be in the same house as me or any of my family, as the thought of my family hearing me talk normally kills me and I cannot do it in front of them.

One time my mum insisted I have a friend round for a weekend, so I did. It was quite horrible, sure it was fun when I locked the door and played games in the attic with him, but when I went down to eat at the table with me him and my mum, I sat in complete silence. Complete. Silence. And he was probably wondering what the fuck was going on, nope just completely normal for me.


**I need help**. But I don't know what to do. I really do not know what to do anymore. I am 16 and I am running out of time. I don't even know if this is curable, I don't even know if it is too late for me, for all I know it could be, I could live a life without talking to my own family, and to me, that is the worst thing that could happen, and I'm not sure if I could live with that. 


I don't know how to go on, SM has been the cause of my depression, and it is the one thing that is holding me back from curing my depression (I can't not be depressed and have selective mutism at the same time, it is not possible for me).


Please help me, in any way you can, I am broken.",suicide,"I am very severely selective mute, I can speak to strangers, but not my own family. I don't know what to do anymore. [m/16]I am 16 and as a result of not receiving full attention as my Dad had to be looked after for the first 7 years of my life (Motor Neurone Disease)/not having a father figure etc, I developed a very bad selective mutism, where I cannot speak to my own family properly, and I can only do basic words and phrases, going beyond makes me feel like hell all over my body. I live in the UK, so the doctors wont do anything and the mental health treatment is pretty much non existent, I haven't even been diagnosed because they don't care at all. **but it gets worse** My brother and sister never attempt to talk to me, I am an outcast, and I am pretty sure that they actually believe that I have severe autism or am retarded in some way, this is because they have never seen me speak to my own friends and strangers in a normal way (and it would kill me inside if they do, thats how SM works). My mum cares about me, but doesn't realise the full extent, she has recently tried to help me by 'talking to me more like an adult', thanks.. I guess.. I mean I am 16 so it's about time.

177280,"The saying 'mum would be sad' is genuinely the only reason i'm still goingI am 21 years old, male, and live in Scotland.


I have dealt with self-harm and suicidal thoughts for approximately 5 years now. Everyday I think about my life ending in some capacity.


It's tough, each day I walk home from University I cross a bridge. Each day I feel I get closer to jumping. But I wouldn't, because it would make my mum sad. 


Everyone says you can get help &amp; everyone's life is worth saving, but I don't think people who say that always understand that for some people, their life just doesn't seem worth saving. 


For starters the idea of going to a doctor/therapist makes me feel ill with worry and anxiety, and I'm not sure why.


I've written a suicide note. I don't plan on killing myself - I just wanted to put how I feel into words. I feel broken.


I have always tried to make everyone else smile as much as possible - perhaps this is due to knowing how it feels to be broken inside and not wanting anyone else to feel like that. Or perhaps it's my acknowledging that for others life can be fun. Just not for me.


I would want to leave by taking one final bow and walking off-stage. This would be my ending. It wouldn't be sad, it wouldn't be my life ending early, it would just be the end of my story.


I wouldn't want people to cry. I wouldn't want people to be sad. I would want to just disappear without any sadness of grief. 


It is this struggle that I find the hardest. I'm really struggling to continue and go on. But I would never want to make my friends sad. I've dealt with depression for a while now so they know about it - but they do not know how extreme it has gotten in the past few weeks.


Every day when I'm driving or walking, I think about if I was to just crash. If it would or wouldn't be my fault, that doesn't matter. Would that be easier to accept than knowing I chose to end my life? Or would people think I was looking forward to my whole life ahead of me.


There was a Reddit post that really resonated with me. The user was depressed, and then found out they had terminal cancer. The top comment was saying that they hope the rest of their days are peaceful and short. That is the kind of closure I would look for.


I'm going out tonight to a club with a few friends. My nights out usually end up with me walking back to my flat (40 mins away) alone. It gives me time to think about everything. When I'm back at my flat I scare myself with my thoughts and actions. I've hurt myself many times before and often think that one day I will take it too far.


I just don't want to be sad, and I don't want anyone else to be sad. I feel like my time here is finished. If I could disappear and not have it affect anyone else then I would take that, 100%.

307195,"Hey all! Its 2:30 am and i could really use some advice! I wont make this too long, but ill try to get enough detail in.

So. Im nearing my 2nd semester of college now, and all the way back to my junior year of highschool i started talking to this girl. And jesus fucking christ did i like this girl. A lot. We would talk every single day, all the time, but almost only solely through text. And this remained a constant all the way to halfway through my senior year. But i could tell things were slightly odd. We almost *never* talked in person, which was odd, as we had a class together and similar free times. Eventually, after i confessed my feelings, after hers seemed to shift almost daily, we stopped talking. For a month. Until she ""tricked"" me into sliding up on her snapchat story and we started talking again. For 2 weeks, until, without telling me, gave me an ultimatum of either confessing my feelings again or stop talking again.

Fast forward, its quarantine. We start talking again. Just as nice as when we first started. Fast forward to college. We would call each other often, watch dumb romance movies together, etc. We became an official ""thing"". Until 4 days later. Where i have now not talked to her again since. She said she was feeling in a funk, and we agreed on a break from talking, and it simply never ended.

And now were here. For the past 2.5 years of my life she has never not been a part of it, even when we werent talking. She has been so influential to everything in my life, and *truly* molded me into the person i am today. But at the same time, she has caused me so much sadness and confusion. 

And i really want to start talking to her again. Things didnt end how i want, and i never really wanted them to. But i truly, honestly, dont know if its a smart thing to do. I don't even know if she would ever want to talk to me again. 

But i think, truly, if i just didnt get attached again, the friendship would be amazing. The only problems that ever occurred was when one of us cared too much, so if its just a normal friendship, that couldn't happen?

Now as someone that knows the most bare of bones of the story, do you have any input at all? Anything is appreciated. And if you want more information just ask. Thank you.",non-suicide,"Hey all!

My parents are exhausting me. They just dont fucking listen and my mom has to go and fuck everything up. I’m going literally insane and they dont seem to notice. Instead they’re always fucking focused on my sisters and whenever I need or want something I always have to pay out of it from my own hands or work for it yet my sister literally asked for slime and my dad just bought her it but now I have to give my dad $80 (a months worth of mowing my uncles lawn) just so I could have a useable bike and a nice setup for school. Now that I have the bike, I can’t do shit with it because my parents dont trust at all and whenever I try to talk to them they tell me how immature and irresponsible I am. MY FUCKING SISTER HAS LESS PUNISHMENT THAN ME AND I’M NOT EVEN GROUNDED.
She literally slapped me and when I slapped her, I got in trouble more than her. It all started just because I tapped her head. I wanted to go biking tmrw since it’s the last day of summer until school and the I can’t go biking. I’ve been using my friends bike for the two months since I didn’t have one. My plan was to bike 5 miles from my uncle’s house to my friend’s house but it’s “too dangerous” because it’s on s busy road. First of, I’m going to be on the sidewalk, second, I have a helmet and Third, I know the law’s and other safety stuff. They think that some dude is just gonna run off the road and hit me. I feel like they’re really over protective and overreacting 

They DO NOT listen to me. My dad was totally up to me biking from uncle’s house but my mom totally changed his perspective. This is what usually happens. She’ll put in her opinion and it changes literally everything yet it seems like I can’t have an opinion. Just this morning my sister was playing Minecraft so I decided to join her. When I went to go borrow some seeds or something, she starts killing me and taking my stuff. Then I took a stone pickaxe (she has diamond) she literally screamed while my dad was sleeping. Instead of my mom helping she yelled at both of us to get of. I got punished for my sisters actions, I just took a pickaxe. I let her take some of my stuff, she’s just being selfish. I stood up for myself and told my mom what had happened yet she didn’t give a fuck what I had to say and I got scolded. 

I’m just sick of this all. I wanna be able to have more freedom and go biking with my friend. It’s my only way of getting outside and being active or even communicating with friends. Literally nobody texts me anymore because I can never go out or hang or whatever. I’m only truly friends with 2 people. Why can’t my parents understand that I have needs too? My sisters constantly have their friend over and her brother (They’re 100% not covid positive) who is way younger than me. I’m gonna be a lonely sophomore that sits in his basement/bedroom doing schoolwork for the next couple months. I would be playing the xbox more and more with friends but my sisters have found a way to ruin it. Plus my main group is kinda getting toxic. It makes me sick to think that this whole pandemic thing could be more tolerable if I had just a little more freedom/social interaction. I’m not talking going to a mosh pit at a blink182 concert or some shit, I just wanna be able to like sit across a table with some friends, all of us wearing a mask, and going biking or getting taco bell.

And usually these thoughts are things that aren't even based on facts. To clear things up:

The LGBT+ community does not want to convert your kids.

The transgender community does not get overly offended when you mess up their pronouns BY ACCIDENT.

Femme- and partially femme-aligned people don't hate all men unless pushed by some sort of trauma.

BLM isn't an organization. Nor is antifa.

Oh, guess what? It still sucks. Everything is still a mess, everything reminds me of my abusive ex, I'm in withdrawal, haven't left the house (which is oddly cold, I don't know why), and I can't drink. 

No one's inviting me out suddenly. Personal representatives from IKEA have not shown up to organize the dumpster that is my room. I'm still sleeping on a mattress in the house of my friend who has no clue what's going on, but knows enough not to invite me out with him because I'm wacked out of my skull right now.

But fuck it. I'm safe. I've been living with a death sentence over my head for weeks. There is nothing having been on your own personal death row. Stuck in a hotel room, drunk, so alone.. so fucking alone, rehearsing over and over jumping, imagining what it will be like, wishing it could be more peaceful.

I don't know if it's going to get better, ya know? Life has not been so kind and I have no idea how people do basic things. But if I'm going to die, why not just take some risks?

I know exercise helps. I know friends help. Getting out of oneself. I know drinking does not help. I didn't have any alcohol today, so I might be in a little withdrawal. So effin lonely, but not feeling like I'm going to die soon is something.

129643,"My suicide note, would like some feedbackI’ve written a suicide note but I’ve sat on it for a few weeks. I thought I had bounced back but anti-life always finds a way.... 

I’d like some critique on it, or maybe just another set of eyes on it. I’m curious what people would think. I’m thinking that I’ll post it to Facebook once I decide to jump off a parking garage. I’m afraid of falling and regretting my decision on the way down but I don’t have any guns and I don’t want to buy any either, so I think jumping might be the best. I don’t want any chances of regretting it past the point of no return. 

Here it is, 


When I was a small child I had thought that the universe solely existed as a torture dungeon specifically designed to cause universal suffering. I thought that I existed solely for pain. This plagued me up until about 3 years ago, or maybe even 2. Perhaps even 1. It’s hard to say because my mind has gradually changed over time since I’ve made significant lifestyle changes, something I’ve had to do probably 3 times with much more to come. 

There was always this feint feeling of hope inside of me, the hope and the desire to change and seek out the life I want to live to become the best version of myself. I had a small hope that reality was actually something inherently good. I’ve actually worked on a theory and formula for proving the positive existence of reality but I’ve hit a pretty big snag this time around. I’ve had smaller psychological breaks before but this one might be the one that does me in. 

Perhaps depression is a self destruct mechanism for genetically dead ends. Perhaps if someone is born without their emotional needs met from a young age, and perhaps if they were never taught the tools on how to form relationships with other human beings, they enter in a self destruct mode (depression) and eventually kill themselves to allow up resources and social-emotional bandwidth to other better off people, or perhaps people inherently stronger than them, like a form of natural selection built right into our DNA. 

Perhaps depression and suicide isn’t abnormal, perhaps the very fact people like me were born is abnormal and depression is the breakdown of our psyche until eventual course correction (suicide). 

To put it another way, the very fact that someone is depressed is natural and their death is assured via psychological natural selection. Perhaps this process is supposed to happen to people like me. I’m the error. 

I have struggled with depression since I can remember. Probably elementary school or even preschool. I was very alone through my entire life. In preschool id hit kids because they wouldn’t hang out with me, and they wouldn’t hang out with me because I hit them. I can feel the echoes of this well into adulthood. Maybe this is why I’m still lonely, maybe this is why I am unloved. Perhaps I was never to exist in the first place and suicide is just course correction for my bloodline; perhaps I am to stop here. I hope I’ve explained this well enough but it might be a bit esoteric. Basically, if you’re suicidal, you’re supposed to die. There isn’t a struggle with depression because you’re supposed to succumb to depression and die. Trying to live is what’s abnormal. 

Every time I see a large group of friends, usually on social media living the lives that I want to live, or a happy couple enamored in romance, I’m hit with intense, unending jealousy. I always wanted to be loved... I always wanted to be apart of a bigger whole so I could never be alone again. Since I was in middle school I always dreamt of having a wife and kids, nothing makes me happier than thinking about a married life.... something so simple as grocery shopping with my wife or playing with my kids on a beach seems paradisal to me. It’s the highest pleasure that I can think of. But it isn’t meant for me. That kind of happiness was never to be mine. 


I had fought this my entire life of 27 years, and maybe it’s a sign from the universe telling me to bow out. This is my self destruct mechanism. It certainly seems like it, why else was I born this way? I never consented to existence anyways. It’s just a prison of isolation.

The ups of life are just a ploy in an effort to cause maximum despair. I’m only allowed to have positive life experiences so that the next negative experience can crush me even harder than the last. It’s a process of entropy to completely crush my soul. 

There’s no shortage of young men who feel just as I do. If you’re wondering why all these school shootings happen, look to this African proverb: 

“It takes a village to raise a child. And if the village rejects the child, the child will burn down the village to feel its warmth”. 

It’s no secret, it’s plain as day. Young men do these things because we feel isolated and unloved, and uncared for. The isolation gives way depression and jealousy. Jealously gives way to to anger, and anger to hatred,  not of other people (technically), but at the structure of reality. These mass shootings are like a twisted way of showing God how awful they feel inside, it’s an expression of dread more than anything. 

I’m not like that though, I don’t hate people. I love humans more than anything, that’s why I hate being at home all the time. I want to be surrounded by lots of people all the time. I want to be one of them. I want to be a human too. A human that can enjoy life, can enjoy compassion and love, that can enjoy acceptance into reality. Instead, I feel as if I was cast from heaven straight into hell. The love of the universe was never something I could have, it existed to torment me. 

My depression was a sign from God, a sign that I was never to exist in the first place. 

I’ve written more about this in the past and maybe I didn’t get everything out. But I feel so cold and alone, loveless, weak, and in pain. I’m tired of the sorrow and the dread. I am tired of fighting for my life. I’m tired of working meaningless jobs with shit benefits. I quit my job and am currently in community college to transfer to a university. I can’t help but feel like I’ve made a huge mistake by chasing my dreams. I can’t get a full time job, I’ve sent out apps for part time jobs with no reply, so I’m broke. I have no money. I’m couch surfing and have a weeks worth of oatmeal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And I have no healthcare because it’s too expensive and isn’t offered to part timers. I’m tired of living like this. 

That’s why I want to end it. I’m the genetic error, I’m the thing that wasn’t supposed to exist. That’s no ones burden but my own. 

So I will bow out. I feel like I should say thanks to everyone who’s helped me come this far, but I don’t even know if any of it was real or not. Maybe this is all one grand illusion. Maybe my life is just one long nightmare. 

I’m sorry if my death causes you pain. But please understand that there isn’t any other way. It’s time for me to say goodbye. 

Thank you.

There is hope!For the first time since I did MDMA on the 3rd of January, I’ve got back that sense of rigidity, stability and purpose; my identity has returned. When I look in the mirror, I don’t see a victim and recoil in disgust, I see a survivor and a warrior who has been through hell and back and has lived to tell the tale. I’m not stuck in a dissociative haze where i forget everything I have done the day after it happens. I feel free to express myself, and I don’t live in constant fear of social judgement. I’m not constantly on the edge, trying to deal with the constant extreme mood swings that plagued me in the months prior to today. Hell, even a few days ago I was convinced that it would never end and I would’ve destined for suicide.

This subreddit has some members in it who are in very dark places. Although it doesn’t seem like it, THERE IS HOPE! You WILL get better, you WILL see the light at the end of the tunnel and you WILL be able to see a future where you are happy and stable. I can’t tell you when that whether that happens tomorrow, in a month or in a few years, but I can promise it will happen.

Now that I’m optimistic again, I need to adjust my lifestyle to continue to feel this way. I plan to do this through exercise, hydration, socialisation and diet.

I hope this gives a sense of hope to those who are struggling, and helps someone out there who is having difficulty finding a reason to continue with the pain. It will get better, I love you all.",suicide,"I beat mental illness today, for the first time in ten months.

I ended a relationship with a girl I thought I would marry because I'm an alcoholic.

Now? I worked out, I'm fit, I got other girls. It means shit.

I can have intimate moments but the 'thing' is missing. There's no excitement about the person, only an expectation of the next pleasure they'll bring which is another drug to push back reality.

I've often wondered if I'm on the autism spectrum but too high functioning.

I want a family but I struggle against it knowing that my family has a history of mental illness. Why should I roll the dice and put someone else through this?

I have a pivotal moment coming up with work which will determine if I call it quits.

I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe one of my sisters will access my phone and find it.

I feel empty. I have to avoid reality. I compartmentalize the parts of my life. When work is over and it's just me, I can't stand it. The hilarious part is I was overwhelmed by the constant wanting of attention in the moment from my ex. It's not a recent break up.

130047,"About 3 hours ago I was told that my dad is going to prison at the beginning of December or soon after I'm a 16yo male, and it's been a really weird weekend. Me and my dad went to a family friends house and bonded really well over the weekend. We've had a good and steadily getting better relationship with each other for close to a year now, since he's never been really able to show he cares even when he does which made it hard to bond

The severity really kicked in all at once about an hour ago and I had a pretty bad mental breakdown of sorts. Still kind of am.

Ever since my sibling moved out a bit more than a year ago it's just been me and my dad. My mom used to be very heavily addicted to drugs so she left when I was about 5ish. And like I said me and dad have really only been chill with eachother for about a year now since he's not great at expressing his feeling for himself or others. He doesn't know I know this and I only found out because my sibling told me once my mom told them.

In all of my life, I've never been scared about something long term or of the sorts. Worried and/or felt sad about? Absolutely. For anyone reading this much, I'm scared. Well honestly I'm horrified, confused, and grieving

I'm horrified and confused because the only thing I know is that his court date is the first of December, and he's almost deffinetly going to jail either that day or very soon after. And as well as why he is in trouble that's all I know. He's not going to be able to pay for the house, so I have to pack everything of mine and move it to one of 3 places. My grandparents which I definitely will not do for certain reasons although they are good people and I love them, move to PA with my mom, gmom, and sibling. Or for an unknown amount of time, move in with a very close family friend who lives in the same town. 

I don't know what I'm going to do yet but I'm so scared of everything right now. I've never had to move in my life. What am I taking? Where am I going to go to?

But my biggest fear of all right now, is what's going to happen to my animals? I love my animals with all of my heart. I have 4 cats and 1 dog. No matter where I go, I can take my dog, so that's better than nothing. But my cats, I keep starting to cry every time I think about them, because right now from what I can tell, there's nowhere I can take them, no matter which of the 3 places I choose. These 4 cats are my friends, my siblings. The oldest one before Sasha died is 13, and I personally picked her out from the litter, she's been with me almost my whole life, I can't just leave and never see her again, and all of my others we've had for at the least 2 years and up to 6. I mean fuck, these animals, which I consider family, are even MORE important than most of my actual family, and I'm fucking crying, cause I can't just leave them somewhere, I don't know anyone who could take them and I need it to be someone we know or trust. 

I don't know if it's a bad, good, or just neutral. But the idea alone, of losing 3 or even all 4 of my cats is honestly my biggest problem right now.

I know that this is alot. I'm sorry for that. If you've read all this or most of it or whatever, thank you so much for just spending time doing it.

164195,"Anyone wanna chat? DM me :)))) P. edulis is a perennial vine; tendrils are borne in leaf axils, and have a red or purple hue when young. There are two main varieties: a purple-fruited type, P. edulis f. edulis, and the yellow-fruited P. edulis f. flavicarpa.[3][4]

Usually the vine produces a single flower 5–7.5 cm wide at each node.[1][5] The flower has 5 oblong, green sepals and 5 white petals.[6] The sepals and petals are 4-6mm in length and form a fringe.[6] The base of the flower is a rich purple with 5 stamens, an ovary, and a branched style.[1] The styles bend backward and the anthers, which are located on top of the styles, have a very distinct head.[6]

The fruit produced is entirely fleshy (making it botanically a berry), and is spherical to ovoid.[3] The outside color of the berry ranges from dark-purple with fine white specks to light yellow.[1] The fruit is 4—7.5 cm in diameter; purple fruits are smaller, weighing around 35 grams, while yellow fruits are closer to 80 grams.[3] The smooth, leathery rind is 9–13 mm thick, including a thick layer of pith.[1][3] Within the berry, there are typically 250 black seeds, each 2.4 mm in length.[6] Each seed is surrounded by a membranous sac filled with pulpy juice.[1] The flavor of the juice is slightly acidic and musky.[1] The passion fruit's flavor can be compared to the guava fruit.[1]",non-suicide,"Anyone wanna chat?

They made my mental illness way worse and they now be like nothing happend.

Why i did not fight back is i was too afraid and they are too many.

I fucked up at school last fall semester, and my parents are pretty much paying for it. I'm taking loans out but they're covering all the other costs. They didn't want to keep paying for me fucking up, so they told me to take a semester off and get a job. It's also worth mentioning that I have crippling anxiety when it comes to work, and no, it's not just laziness. I get panic attacks at work constantly, but I'm good at faking being okay, and I don't want to talk to anyone about it. I tried really hard for a few months with nothing turning up, and then I got a job that involved manual labor. I'm pretty fat so I was pretty fucking miserable. After driving home one night hurting all over, outside and in, I decided to quit before the job really affected me. Then came another few months of unemployment, as well as more disappointment from family. I felt like such a worthless failure. The only thing that kept me going, and the only thing keeping me going now, is the guilt that comes from knowing how much I'd hurt other people if I offed myself.

Now I've got a job in a call center, working 9 hour shifts 5 days a week. I get calls from sales representatives who, most of the time, berate me if I dare even ask them to repeat anything they said for verification. I hate it there, but it's the only job I was able to get that wasn't manual labor.

My daily routine now consists of waking up, feeling like shit, and listening to guided meditations to calm me down so I can go to work. Then I go to work. Then I come home and go right to sleep because I'm fucking exhausted. And then weekends come, and I have to turn down invites to social things from friends because I'm mentally exhausted. There's nothing for me to look forward to any more.

TL;DR: So basically, my life boils down to hating myself because I'm too anxious and depressed to get a job, or living life with little to no remotely positive feelings because work makes me panic. The only reason I keep going is because I don't want to hurt people, but that guilt is slowly being drowned out by complete fucking misery and the desire to end it.

Then came another few months of unemployment, as well as more disappointment from family. I felt like such a worthless failure. The only thing that kept me going, and the only thing keeping me going now, is the guilt that comes from knowing how much I'd hurt other people if I offed myself. Now I've got a job in a call center, working 9 hour shifts 5 days a week. I get calls from sales representatives who, most of the time, berate me if I dare even ask them to repeat anything they said for verification. I hate it there, but it's the only job I was able to get that wasn't manual labor. My daily routine now consists of waking up, feeling like shit, and listening to guided meditations to calm me down so I can go to work. Then I go to work. Then I come home and go right to sleep because I'm fucking exhausted. And then weekends come, and I have to turn down invites to social things from friends because I'm mentally exhausted. There's nothing for me to look forward to any more. TLDR: So basically, my life boils down to hating myself because I'm too anxious and depressed to get a job, or living life with little to no remotely positive feelings because work makes me panic. The only reason I keep going is because I don't want to hurt people, but that guilt is slowly being drowned out by complete fucking misery and the desire to end it. Sorry the post is so long, I'm just getting all this shit out before I go to work so I don't have much time to edit and cut things down concisely.",suicide,0.57013565,0.83050555,0.34578362,0.48814207,0.59306264

I tried to off myself at 13. I didn't do it in a violent way, and when my mom took me to the hospital, the doctors said that i'd have to go to a mental hospital for a week, but that my mom could drive me. she was trying to console me, and i was scared. Really scared.

Please ask for some details if this is too vague lol, but I just don’t know how to fix things between a split fight or disagreement. I’m mostly worried about one friend here.

Now, what sickens me here is that im pretty much 90% sure that some of the content I ended up watching (1 or 2 videos) was actual rape footage uploaded to kinky porn sites, at that age I was ignorant and weren't empathetic enough to really understand how awful that videos actually were Today I feel completly sick for having enjoyed that, thoughts like I deserve to die or that im a monster are recurrent in my head",suicide,0.5523297,0.3227315,0.07089214,0.58218586,0.6520144

She was nice and I felt like she was mostly listening to me and wanted to help but the scope of my issues is just too wide for any one conversation to make a dent. Ive seen this sentiment shared here before so Im hoping someone else might understand.

I contact hotlines when things get rough so I can be physically occupied for a bit and talk about how i feel without bothering the people in my life who are just as burnt out and scared and confused by my problems as I am. So I dont think my expectations are too high or anything. I dont expect to be fixed or helped or understood, just acknowledged. And I usually get that and it usually calms me down.

Other times I feel ashamed when I notice the other person trying to end the conversation and I get clingy and resist because I just dont want to be alone again.

54390,"Failed Attempt and a Life Story to Go AlongHello Reddit, this is my first post on here although under circumstances that aren't very pleasant I'm afraid. It is currently 3am as I type this message at my computer and about 2 hours prior I found myself walking down the stairs of my apartment and tying a belt around the rail and wrapping it around my neck. I let go and after a few seconds everything started to gradually blur until I had complete tunnel vision to the wall that was in front of me. The belt that I used was fairly low quality and snapped under my weight (about 150 pounds). I don't remember the feeling of hitting the ground but when I was able to process what happened I found myself gasping for air and trying to make sense of my surroundings (my vision was similar to that of an out of focus DSLR camera). Unfortunately, this was not the first time I've made an attempt on my own life.

The beginning of Freshman year seemed fairly nice, I had my friends from middle school going to the same school that I would be attending, my classes were all rather straight forward and simple, and the teachers that I was assigned to were all rather likable. As the years went on however, my happiness began to deteriorate. Friends that I have known for years either left or simply chose to not associate themselves with me anymore. I ended up finding myself with a group of ""friends"" that I didn't even feel like striking up conversation with. Many of these people came in the ladder years of my high-school ""career"" and I found them to be unlikable and vile people that only found interesting conversation in berating those that even chose to associate with them in the first place. 

After telling who I thought was the closest friend I had left in our little group that we should distance ourselves from these despicable individuals, he brushed it off and left me on my own. I didn't think that it was a big deal and told myself that I should focus on my classes more (as my grades also began dropping during this time period) so I went on my way and tried making new friends. 

Making new friends proved difficult however, due to convenient rumors beginning to surface that I was homosexual. This was not true but was understandably believable due to the fact that I am a pretty socially awkward guy and have a very difficult time convincing any girl to see me as more than a friend. So because of this I ended up hanging out with the dudes more often. Normally homosexuality is tolerated in today's society, but because of the mindsets of the popular individuals at this particular school, it was not. Once these rumors got to the point of common knowledge, hearing sexist slurs tossed my way would be me having an easy day. I found myself being jumped before and after school, having items stolen from me, and being isolated, as no one wanted to be known for hanging around ""the skinny faggot"". I will admit that I am not completely innocent in all of this either. I've seen my fair share of school fights and street brawls with these people. I was not letting myself be pushed around, and it even came to a point that I was in a knife fight with this same group of people. I always carried a 6 inch switchblade in my jeans simply because of the neighborhood that I lived in. I ended up losing the knife fight and was stabbed. I simply couldn't go get help from the authorities at this point even if I thought they would be useful.

The knife fight was the breaking point for me wanting to switch schools, so I convinced my mom that the teachers were simply terrible at their jobs and I needed to transfer. After switching to a much more mellow school I finished my Senior year with relative ease, although my grades were still damaged due to my lack of effort at the previous school. After graduation I felt empty I suppose. Everyone that I've met from high school for better or worse simply vanished. I realized that I had no true friends. Even friends outside of school gradually stopped talking with me and even when I tried striking up conversation they would act evasive, claiming that they were doing something important at the moment and would call me back later. Everyone that used that excuse never held up to their word. This sense of isolation is what I feel was a contributing factor for me to enter my mom's med cabinet and swallow what was left of her Vicodin prescription. It wasn't nearly enough to kill me and ended up making me sick enough to vomit the majority of it out anyway, but it was what I considered my first suicide attempt. Ever since my graduation in June of last year, I've become increasingly more jaded and disillusioned with both society and my own existence. I have a job but still much more free time than I used to in high school so I've used that free time to read facts on today's society, pick up and continue hobbies, and exercise. Even with this I'm still not happy, I don't find fulfillment in anything that I do, even if I previously enjoyed what I did. People always say I see the worst in every situation and I need to learn to be more positive. I reply with a lie saying that I'll work on it but in my mind I am appalled by blind optimism. My father was a drunk and constantly at odds with my mom. He was not abusive or anything terrible like that, but he was one thing: a complete failure of a father figure. When my mom finally decided that enough was enough and kicked him out, I was always optimistic that he'd come back a changed man and that we'd all be happy again. Of course I was afforded no such luxury.

Blind optimism leads to disappointment,
Disappointment leads to disillusion,
Disillusion leads to cynicism, 
And cynicism leads to suicide. 

Those were the words written on my note. 

As I type this concluding statement it is 4am. I'm tired and will probably not proofread this so please forgive any typos or grammatical mistakes that I've overlooked. If anybody has some words of wisdom they'd like to share, I welcome them.

147978,"I got friend-zoned :(( So, first of all i do have to apologize for bad grammar /spelling cause im gonna be typing this pretty fast. Anyways, so a bit of context till i get to the main part of this story. Im a girl and im bisexual. My bestfriend (who is also a girl) just recently came out as bi herself. I think i've always had a crush on her, but since she identified as straight i thought i just liked her in a friend sort of way 

&amp;#x200B;

boy was i wrong 

&amp;#x200B;

So my crush/ friend (lets call her E) has a crush on another girl (lets call her N) I knew and i guess it was kinda my fault for catching feelings for E. Anyways, I told E over insta yesterday that i had a crush on her, and she said that she had already knew it since i make it VERY obvious unintentionally. She told me she was fine with it and even said stuff like ""Im cute admit it   ;-)"". It was maybe a bit discouraging but I dealt with it fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

But what really hurt is today in class she just randomly said to me ""im such a simp for N"". She kept talking about how much she likes N and I acted all smiley and happy on the outside but im tearing up on the inside. She knows I like her, why does she do this? idk. Do I hate her for doing this? sorta wish i could, but i really can't. Both E and N are having a hangout with some other friends this weekend - and I'm coming. I kind of don't wanna see there faces ever again and yeah, I'm definitely a bit jealous of N, but I'll really never let it show. 

And I know this sounds really stupid and childish but both N and E have matching pfps on discord and im really jealous - why can't I just be happy for them? ;-;

Oh and another thing N is an online friend who lives in the same city as us so we've never actually met her irl. But i feel like she's replacing my spot in the friend group, It took me SO long to get friends and now this happens. I just really wanna be important to them but nowadays i feel like im not. 

oh, and if N or E see this post (you know who you are) act like you never did.

anyways thanks to everyone that took there time to read up to here, and if you have any advice plz spill

325398,"I dont know anymoreI don't know how much I have the energy to write plus I won't probs care abt grammar that much rn so I am sorry for this mess.

I have been mildly derpressed my whole childhood, I have always been masculine which I have been bullied about at school and home. Things got worse around sixth grade (abt 12yo) when I stopped getting any ""entertainment"" from my usual things like playing and school and tv etc. Around this time I also realized I was fat and started to struggle with weight management. I started to lose weight ""very unhealthily"" basicallt eating almost nothing. And I got to a weight where I'm now able to hide my slight chubbyness with clothes.

This all went unnoticed by my family since my sister started cutting and being suicidal and I didnt want to add to that. 

Fastforward to eight grade(14-15yo) I started to struggle with anxiety and my depression gpt a bit worse. During ninth grade anxiety gpt even worse and depression with that. 

16yo I didnt have anxiety issues anymore but my depression got alot worse, quickly. During this time I was also manipulated by a ""friend"" who at the end ended up forcing me to some sexual stuff. Thia destroyes me completely. I started smoking and walking on roads wishing that a car would hit me or walking on train tracks etc. I started having some self harming tendensies. Summer came so things easiet up coz I got away from the person who manipulated etc me. At this time my depression was at its worse

I changed schools during the summer coz I couldnt go back to my old school because of this person. Around this time my dpression was abt the same as earlier but i managed it better and didnt do selfharm stuff. 

Now school started around 3months ago. I have not gotten any better and for abt 3weeks it has started getting rly bad again. I keep fantasizing dying but rn im at that point that I wont do it coz I dont want to hurt my family. Kind pf waiting for my self to stop being a pussy so I dont need to suffer anymore. 

The thing is that I havent rly told anyone how bad it is because I cant, its completely against my personality and I just cant. Plus I dont want to cause negativitt to my friends etc life.

Also around 14-15yo i was hopeful like ""oh but it wiöö get better"", i still try to force myself to think that but im definitely losing hope, Things have just gotten worse during the last 5years and I dont know how long I'll be able to not break and honestly this even scares me a bit.

I dont even know the point of this post but i needed to tell someone and I thought that maybe itll feel better after writing (+i cant write to my friends etc)


But like I said im just really, really done. I have been so depressed these last three weeks and the only time i didnt feel completely shit was when I was drinking but I'm starting to have problems with that too(+basically starting to have some unhealthy ""habits""). I dont see any hope in the future and I just dont want to live anymore. I cant do anything, I dont remember anything (i feel like I keep dissociating all the time or something like that idk, but I cant remember even the whole day without rly having to think abt it and maybe even but the either). I cant sleep, but im always tired so I just lay in bed. I cant eat because it makes me wanna throwup and just the thought of eating is causing an uneasy feeling in my stomach. I cant study but I keep going to classes so my parents dont notice my illness (i dont live with them but they got notified since im under 18 if i dont go to class). Basically I cant rly do anything and I just keep feeling worse and crying all the time.

Thanks for reading if someone did (also I wrote this also because if i get worse and end up taking mylife(not planning rn) maybe my family will find this from my phone and understand a bit)

I guess I just need some encouragement or something to keep living idk, please something positive.

(New to reddit so if this breaks rules or something and is in wrong sub or something, just delete idk)

308954,"My stupid mates cancelled me 😡😡 All I said was **""I am a vegetarian from now and I will only eat** ***Vegans*****.""** 

They started calling me *Cannabis* and stuff. I know everything, people think Veg people do drugs and therefore my friend tried to insult me by calling me a Cannabis.

But I still tried to rationally argue with him. "" I said I will only eat vegans. not all Veggies do drugs.""

He was like ""What?"" (His little brain was baffled by my superior logic)

What's more horrible is that one of my friend comes to me and says ""Dude, I am a Vegan."" He was mocking me, he was trying to say the same old point carnivore people say *Vegans are living also, like me, look I am a vegan, will you eat me haha.*

202127,"Losing battle with anxiety.I've been fighting a battle to get my severe anxiety symptoms under control.  It started with a visit to the doctor about 2 months ago.  Then I was prescribed pills.  Then I had a suicidal, psychotic break.  Then I was committed to a mental institution for a day.  Then I returned to work the next day and arranged a 2-week leave of absence.  I've been seeing a psychiatrist 2-3 times a week for the past month and I'm trying to resolve my issues through behavioral therapy rather than SSRIs.

I tried my hardest to get back on track with work last week.  The work stress ramped up again and by Friday night I was a wreck.  I spent the entire weekend in a suicidal, angry state.  My job is stressful but it's a field with amazing potential if dedicate myself to it, and I don't want to derail myself from that track.

This morning I woke up have been overwhelmed by dry heaving ever since.  It's my worst physical anxiety symptom, and it's been one of the worst parts of my life for the past 2 years.  I become paralyzed throwing up, but nothing comes out.  I've been going in an out of meetings while dry heaving and trembling in between.  When I go into meetings, enough adrenaline kicks in to keep my body in the zone, so I don't dry heave in those situations.  But it's killing me.  Hiding it is killing me.  Pretending to be strong and fine is killing me.

I think the dry heaving produces endorphins.  I think I'm addicted to those endorphins to get barely enough focus and function to get back on track.

I can't afford to let my coworkers know that I'm continuing to have anxiety problems.  My career is everything to me.  At this point, after already using a leave of absence, I need to tackle the anxiety problems privately going forward to retain the job.

I have no friends and I'm going to be 30 in a few months.  I'm a recovering codependent.  I had some different counseling last year which revealed to me that almost all of my relationships were toxic.  I used to be a stereotypical ""nice guy"" but now I'm a just a confused asshole.  I don't have the required social skills to jibe with how I've had to reinvent myself.

All I can think about is killing myself.  I keep saying it more and more.  The words ""I want to kill myself"" seem to compulsively project from my mouth hundreds of times a day when I'm alone.  I can't get it under control.

Everyday, it's always the same thing. It's all I can hear. ""You're fat."" ""You don't try hard enough."" ""Worthless."" ""Ugly.""

I've been staying in the same school since I was in preschool, so I'm a bit more sheltered than most teenagers. All my life, I have been hearing these words again and again on repeat. It hurts even more when my own flesh and blood says it to me.

My little brother is three years younger than me, so I try to understand it from his point of view. But no matter how I try, I can't fathom why he feels so happy when he calls me degrading names and makes me cry. He has even told me to kill myself a few times. I try to keep the tears in, but it only drowns me inside.

So I turn to cutting. At first, I didn't understand why people would cut themselves. Then I realized that when I cut, the physical pain blocks my emotional pain and for awhile, I forget. I let go. But it's only for awhile and then it comes crashing down to me again. Why did I do that? Now I will forever have these scars. Then I vow to myself never to cut again.

Except I did.

And now I can't even turn to my friends, because everytime I even try to talk to them, they're talking about something that I can't relate to, and I feel so out of place.

My dad and his lover don't really care. They'll scold my brother when he antagonizes me, but that's it. Now he's got the idea that it's okay to abuse me, since that's what my dad used to do to mom when they were still together.

Day by day, my cuts get deeper. One day, I might cut too deep. And sometimes, I wish I do. Then I get scared of dying.

158671,"My life in a nutshell Now first i just want to clearly state, that all of this information is 100% genuine. If you, also, are running through issues in life, i honestly wish you the best of luck. Sorry for lack of formatting, I'm writing this from my mobile phone.  


Alright, little backstory: Both my parents are still alive, i have 2 sisters and 3 brothers. My father has been having crippling depression for 30 years, has a very bad back, is diabetic, and works his ass off everyday. My family of 8 people has a 150 dollar food and other stuff budget. He does not have a work per hour job, however he owns his own personal bussiness company (he buys in damaged cars, repairs them, resells them). However everything just seems to fail in the most miserable ways ever, as if there is some god testing his patience for years. Despite me not knowing a lot about my family, I can at least talk about what he's ranting about in the living room to my mother.

He has a couple brothers and sisters, but thats not important right now.
He used to work with his brother, but would always either get a very low amount of money/nothing/his brother would say dumb shit to him. His brother always goes to their parents (which are 70+) to tell ""their part of the story"" (whilst my father doesnt). This lead my grandparents have a hatred for my father. My father is depressed, as i said. And last couple weeks its turning out pretty bad. 

Rent hasn't been paid for 4 months, yesterday he had a serious conversation with brother number 2. over the phone (it did not go well), about something involving cars and how brother 2 could be the reason that my dad loses his cars, his garage company, aka his life work. This will 100% result my dad to either commit suicide or get a heart attack (im serious.)

My part of life: 

I have autism, i could not say that i have depression as i didnt have a psychologist for years.
Anyway, years ago in middle school, i had 3 children in my class that would always really annoy me. However, dont get me wrong, I had mad strength and anger management issues. Their goal was not to bully me, but to push me over the border. (what most likely would cause me to one-punch hospitalize them, but would also get me expelled, which is what they wanted.) As if it wasnt bad enough, this dumb ass middle school made us every grade have their own part of the ""playground"" (i have no idea what its called, im dutch), which meant we HAD to play football (soccer) together. Now, my friends against these 3 idiots never went well. My best friend has crippling depression because his parents always fought, and once he almost got beat to death by his father.


Those 3 kids would always go to the principal during the break, telling stories how me and my friend do stuff (i never actually knew what they were saying.) However, one time when i was absent, they went to the principal to say that me and my friends were being extremely racist to them. (bullshit). She goes ballistic, goes to our class and threatens to call the police on us. i heard about this next day.

There was this one time that my best friend, during football against the lads, got 10v1'd by the 3 people and their brothers /friends. My friend is about 1m30 at the time, the smallest person, however was by far the best player (a talent). he actually managed to stand his ground a score a goal whilst 10 people of 1.80 meters are literally using lethal force against my friend. (he could hit his head against one of the playground obstacles and die. it was not looking great.) However after his godly goal, one of the 3 went to get the ball, FELL OVER MY BROTHER'S FOOT, AND BLAMED HIM.  MOTHERFUCKER ATTACKED MY BROTHER FOR IT. then I ran at the fuckface at a 30km/u pace, giving him one clean punch in the face, breaking his nose, braces, glasses, giving him a concussion from falling, and VERY INTENSE nose bleeding. 50 people then proceeded to hold me to prevent me from hospitalizing the other 2. I later got a code red ( 3 code reds means expelled ). this was their goal all along. i didnt care. dont fucking touch my brother.


Later on when i've cooled down, we had to get to talk to the dude a week later. guess fucking what? this iS APPARENTLY how it went:

""I wanted to shoot the ball, but (my brother) didnt let me. he wanted to kick me to hurt me. i told him multiple times to give me the space and to leave me alone. he didnt let me"".
 
 
 
 
 Holy fucking shit you have no idea how fucking mad i were. he was right across the table, talking mad shit right in my eyes. They denied everything i said. Everything was my fucking fault. I wanted to kill the dude.



I have at least 2k lines of rant left but my hands are hurting and i dont feel good atm, might make another post.


however rn im in Gymnasium 5.

(This is our school education system: 
worst to best: praktijk, basis kader, kader, mavo, havo, atheneum+gymnasium). 
Fuckers are doing Basis kader. When we were friends, i helped them cheat in a very important central exam that would determine where we'd go. they all got the highest 1% because of me. we all got in real trouble.

How can my entire life be judged on one single letter? Is is it just me, or is something wrong with that picture? 

When I was younger I was happy. I wanted to be a vet. I would draw pictures of animals and even had an empty jug of grape juice that I would fill with dirt and place random insects inside of it to watch them develop and eventually die.

Nowadays I dream of being rich, having a big house, being famous (who doesn't). I voice my dreams to my parents, and they shoot me out of the skies screaming that I'll never achieve my dreams because I'm getting D's and C+'s in school.

Fast-forward to grade 6 and my dad tells me that I'll never be a vet because I got a C+ in Math, among other terrible grades. It's just ink on a fucking 8.5 x 11 paper.

I walk around the house, campus, and public with a straight face because I've never truly felt comfortable with my situation in a *long* time. My brain is filled with thoughts of what the fuck I'm going to do next if I get another D. My smiles feel awkward, and my frown is turning into a permanent wrinkle between my eyebrows.

I think about school and I can't wait to get it over with. If I don't drop out, that is. But what about after that? What do I do after I walk across that stage for the last time? What do I do? What's the point? 

My cat is the only person who cares about me. He wakes me up at 7:30 in the morning every single day. I haven't owned an alarm clock in 3-4 years because of Sporty's morning habits. He greets me when I get home, and he purrs beside my ear when I try to fall asleep at night. He's 10, and aging quickly. I remember when I first got him in November. He was small and could fit in my hand. Now he's big, fat, and requires my entire upper body strength to carry. Once he's dead I don't know what I'll do. I want to get him cremated so I can carry his ashes around with me forever. 

Everyone I know crucifies me for playing video-games. They are my outlet. When I tell them I play World of Warcraft they roll their eyes and scoff at me. Is WoW somehow worse than watching Jersey Shore re-runs every single night? How come no one understands? 

I'm left-handed. I have a crazy theory that all people born left-handed will turn out to be successful and worthwhile citizens in society. Off the top of my head, Matt Damon, Eminem, Barack Obama, Tom Cruise, Curtis Jackson, Oprah. I look at my life and all I see is a future of failure, heartbreak, and misery.

Thinking about all the problems I have, and not knowing how to deal with them or if I can, makes me grow more desperate. I feel alone and like I’m slowly drowning.

I’ve tried to improve by myself and I can’t. It’s too much to deal with on my own. My only hope for getting help or some counseling is in a few months in college. But the idea of making it there is looking bleaker, and I may not even be able to get help anyways. I doubt I’ll even be able to function in college if I keep deteriorating like I am now either. Not even just mentally, but as a person I feel like I’m getting worse. Becoming more bitter, negative, and just shitty. It’s like I’m slowly on the path to insanity or something, and I don’t know how to change course. I don’t want to be alive to see myself downgrade more not knowing how to stop.

I have no clue how to deal with my emotions on my own. I know I have a lot of suppressed emotions from all the bullshit that’s happened this year, but idk how to deal with it all on my own. I can’t keep living with this pain for a few more months. When there’s not even a guarantee that it’ll get better, and I have nothing to keep me going to make up for it. 

This year has been the absolute worst of my life. Not only did my internal problems get 100x worse, with my stupid intrusive thoughts and ocd starting right at the beginning of the year, I had to deal with the loss of a family member and all the grief and painful shit that comes with that. Which I still don’t know how to deal with completely and I know it’s the main thing that’s messing me up right now. I didn’t know what real pain and problems were until this year. Everything else before was stupid. I’d give anything to go back and have the fucking “problems” I had the last 3 years. 

Thats the main thing that’s affecting my home life and my relationship with my mom. I don’t know how to communicate with her about anything anymore. It’s like I’ve emotionally shut myself off from her for some reason. These past few months. The good relationship I had with her I’m slowly ruining. I don’t want to be alive to see myself getting more estranged from her. Im scared of losing her, maybe not even just physically but emotionally too. But it feels like that’s what’s gonna end up happening, if nothing else happens to her, and I don’t know how to stop it.  

I get anxiety being around her, worrying about losing her young too and something happening to her or her developing some problem. I don’t want to deal with the pain and stupid grief of losing another parent. Fuck I can barely handle the loss of one. I’d rather die than go through it again. It’s like that security and comfort I had is gone. It’s like now I know anything can happen, because that’s just how the world fucking works. There’s no guarantee or security that something won’t happen again. 

It’s almost unbearable, the worry and anxiety over this. So I’m slowly distancing myself from her and cutting ties emotionally I guess. To protect myself from some pain or loss that hasn’t even fucking happened yet. It’s ironic, I don’t want to lose her but yet I’m ruining our relationship and wasting the time I have with her now while I have her. Because of fear of losing her in the long run soon. It’s stupid.

This year I’ve wasted all the energy I had with people and to make friends, on toxic ones. It’s happened to me three separate times. the last one was like two months ago. It’s fuckin taxing, starting a friendship with someone you think will be worthwhile and putting in the effort, only to later find out they were just using me or being manipulative, or they just plainly showed they did not care about me at all, and having to cut them off or stop talking to them because it’s just worse. Just giving myself more unnecessary pain and trauma than I already had to deal with. It hurts. And I know it’s my own fault for not seeing the signs. I tell myself I learned my lesson and it won’t happen again, but I know it probably will because I’m just gullible and easily manipulated. I’d give anything to go back and not have met any of them . I wasted my time and effort and was only met with more problems now, and pain in the end. 

Those “friendships” led me to now be more hesitant to talk to people and reach out, when it wasn’t as much of a problem for me before. So now when I meet people that I know would be good friends or it would be a healthy friendship or something, I hesitate to talk to them. Messaging people back makes me more anxious now and I hesitate a lot more to, and it takes me days now at best to get the courage to respond. Even if I know they want to talk to me or do stuff with me. Obviously ruining the friendship before it really even starts, because how the fuck can it work like that. Fuck I even get scared to open social media now sometimes for some reason. Like discord or snap and some other places. I don’t know why, it’s like it reminds me or something. It’s bullshit. I fucked myself up more. I wish I hadn’t given my time and energy to those people when they were the last ones to fucking deserve it. Maybe it’s better that I don’t make friendships as easily, who tf would want to talk to me anyways. There are better people out there.

I have absolutely nothing keeping me going, except a small hope in myself and the hope that it can get better in college. But it just feels stupid and that hope is lessening more and more. It feels like everyone else has at least one person or external thing that keeps them going or pushing through the bad. Everytime I think I have something, it just ends up failing or it gets ruined. But it’s just right that I’m not one of those people. I messed up everything for myself with my choices and actions. Maybe if I did have something I’d be able to push through all this crap.

I isolated myself from my group of friends that I know cared somewhat, a few weeks ago, because I felt like I was bothering them too much and just annoying them. And now I fucking lost them. One of the few good things that happened to me this year. Like the idiot I am. It’s funny how I gravitate towards the people harmful to me easily while pushing away the ones that are good for me. 

There’s no one that cares. The ones that claim to just do it out of pity. They’d all move on anyways, I’m not important enough to be remembered or be sad over for too long. Just easily forgotten and forgettable. There are better people out there anyways and life goes on. 

I’m tired of waking up to face another day with either false hope or mental/emotional pain. I don’t want to cry any more useless tears. Hopefully these are the last ones I ever have to. I don’t want to see myself get worse in multiple aspects. I don t want to keep searching for something to keep me going or to make the pain worthwhile. I don’t want to see everything around me crumble even more. I don’t want to deal with anymore pain. I have too many problems that I don’t know how to fix and I can’t keep dealing with for the next few months, the easier way is just to end it. I should’ve done it back in the summer when I had the urges and means to for the first time. Sure things got better for a time but now I’m here. even worse than before. Anyone in my place would have killed themselves months ago probably.

I would’ve never thought my life would end up like this a few years ago. That’d it reach this point. It even hurts to fucking look in the mirror at this point sometimes. To see how I’ve ended up and what I’ve become. I don’t even recognize myself anymore. Anything good I had is just overshadowed by the bad and all the crap now. Its like it’s all I can see in myself now, more and more everyday. Sure I’m still young and things can turn around. But it won’t happen on its own and I feel like I’m on a bad path that I can’t turn around from, myself, anymore. 

There’s no point in being alive to witness myself become something I despise even more. I see hints of that now and it hurts. 

I played my cards wrong in life and I’m paying the consequences now I guess. I doubt I’ll be alive by the end of this year. There’s no guarantee things won’t be just as bad or worse next year, or heck even for the rest of my life. I’ll probably chicken out and not have to courage to do anything this weekend.

330220,"Saying goodbye to my teenage years I've been thinking for quite some time about posting  since for quite some time I felt weird about staying here.

It's going to be a long one, so I don't expect anyone to read but if you do, thanks for giving me a few of your moments today.

I'm 23 years old trans-woman from a lower working class background. I've been openly living as trans woman for 4 years. All my friends and most of my family knows about me. Some took it well and some decided that I don't really have a place in their life and that's ok.

But ever since I came out of a closet I've been thinking about my teenage years. I realized that I never had any teenagehood whatsoever. I was too caught up in conflicts with my sexuality and gender, with conflicts with my surrounding and lack of any significant material means. I thought no one really understood me because I didnt understand myself so I couldn't enter any significant relationships at that time and I felt alienated.

Becuase I havent experienced much of the teenage years as they are often portrayed I started to revision that time again and again. I was daydreaming very often about ""time that never was"" and how happy I would have been if I knew myself. How much I miss my friends (they pretty much all left the country at this point) and how much fun we had and would have had if I knew who I was.

I dont think that's healthy though and recently I started to think I need to let my teenage self go. It won't happen. I'm old(er) now. Im no longer a Teenager. I dont go to highschool. I have full time Job And responsibilities within my family. My friends are gone and this time is gone too.

And the thought really brings me to tears because I cant stop thinking how much time I lost. I feel like Proust character, going back, looking for feelings and moments that arent here anymore.

I know this past year has been probably the shittiest year to be a Teenager in a long time, but I still envy you.

Thanks for having me this past few years but I think soon it will be time to finally march forward although it really scares me.

118405,"I'm a TOTAL failure and I hate this life, I don't want to live anymoreI'm just gonna write here my ""life"" story, I don't really know what else to do

I'm a 23 years old male, I don't have any friends, never had a girlfriend, never even kissed a girl. I repeat, I'm 23.

I was a normal kid, a bit shy, but had many friends, hanging out with them every day, playing sports and just doing what kids do. I was very interesting in universe &amp; football. People liked me, I was an intelligent &amp; fun kid, I remember my 4th grade teacher telling my mom that I'm a little genius. I was even really handsome until I hit puberty.

When I was 13, I completely stopped going out, I started spending my time on a computer. All of my time. I lost all of my real life friends and found some internet friends instead - I talk only to one of them now.

My posture got fucked up pretty quickly, obviously because of sitting on the computer all the time, I developed a forward head syndrome, kyphosis, lordosis, winged scapula etc. Puberty really fucked me up. I'm that guy who people laugh at when they see him, or just think for themselves ""what a weirdo"", even my ex-classmate from elementary school who saw me after years said ""man what happened, you walk like a retard"" and many people told me I look weird, well I can see it every day in the mirror.

When I was 18, I had a huge acne, all over my face and neck. Still got scars on my face. I will never forget how were people looking at me, with pure disgust in their eyes, my classmates were laughing at me every day. I was bullied also physically but not that much, in elementary school, I think that's when I lost all of my confidence and became scared of people.

But looks isn't my only problem, even tho it's one of the biggest causes of my SOCIAL ANXIETY. I can't talk to people, I don't know what to say when I talk to someone, I just became retarded. I don't know how to behave in social situations, I don't know how to react, I just don't know what to say and even if I have something to say, it's always awkward, even if I'm trying to say something funny, people never laugh, so I'm better quiet all the time.

I was unemployed for 2,5 years, now I work in a job that I hate, making peanuts, I can't expect anything else since I have only high school education. Why? Because I don't have any hobbies, I'm not interested in anything, I don't have any talents, I've been trying to find something since I was 18.
I'm living only with my mom in a one room appartment and our biggest problem is money, since I was a child.

My mom is trying to do everything for me, even now, and all I want in this life is her to be happy, I don't care about me anymore. I want her to be financially free, to not be stressed every day. But I'm just a failure that can't do anything

I have to wake up in 4 hours and go to that fucking stupid pointless job again, I don't even want to go to bed, I'm getting anxious even when I think about it :(

I was working out for like a year a couple of years ago, my body got a little bit better but really just a little bit, I still looked like a fucking weirdo, now it's much worse tho and I don't have any energy to do anything. I'm tired all the time, I don't have any energy, it's like my body already gave up, I don't want to do anything, just leave this body, but at the same time I don't want to, because it would ruin the lives of my family.

I'm an extremely clumsy and unskilled person, I can't do anything, I don't know anything

I feel trapped here and I'm not enjoying this life at all

I tried to write this post not too emotionally, but believe me I feel like the most useless, ugliest, dumbest weirdo in the world.

301087,"I've fucked upHello guys. I'm writing to tying y'all once again.

This time I fucked up very hard.

So... In November I started dating a girl from my work, I know I shouldn't do it but I really liked her. I've dated another girl from that same job and it didn't end up well. But I started dating this new girl anyway. We were liking each other. I think she even was in love with me. But I hidded a STD from her, and last week I told her.

213005,"Happy or sad, suicide always seems bestIt was about 9 1/2 years ago that I said ""if I'm not happy with life in 10 years I'm going to kill myself."" I'm getting rather close to my deadline and despite the fact that there are slightly more ""good days"" now than at some points I still have no desire to live.

When I'm happy I just think ""man this would be a good day to end on, everything is going pretty good, and it's definitely gonna go downhill after this."" Then shortly after of course it does, and at that point I enter the more familiar depressive suicidal ideation. And no, that doesn't mean ""it will get better."" It just means that for every month of being depressed I might have a week of reprieve. The reason I set the 10 year timeline was to make sure that it wasn't a fad or a phase, since so many people make that claim.

Unlike a lot of depressed/suicidal people I don't have a lot of the more typical thoughts. I don't feel like ""I can't do anything right"", I don't think that ""nobody cares about me"", I don't think anyone has wronged me, etc. On the contrary I have lots of talents that I feel are going to waste, I have lots of people that care for me which makes the decision to kill myself much more difficult and frustrating, and I have had so many ""blessings"" it seems entitled to throw them away. 

However the modern world and society have absolutely nothing to offer me. There are no jobs that sound marginally appealing, and in fact I've cut back on working so much that I can't even support myself (which adds to my embarrassment/failure). Before when I was working enough, I was so miserable literally 100% of the time that I simply couldn't stand it. Figured it'd be better to be destitute and only sometimes miserable than making decent money and always miserable. I've tried dozens of jobs and quit them anywhere from a few months to a couple years. I see no chance that in 6 months my outlook will change.

I figure I'll get my degree then do the deed so at least I'll have accomplished something before I pass. By the time I'm what mid thirties still alone whats the point.

229102,"It's never going to endI've been suicidal since I was 12, over half my life. I attempted it numerous times in high school by swallowing pills. I got help, my circumstances improved, and I'm still on antidepressants. 

The thing is, I never felt happy to be alive. Even at my happiest, all I could think was, ""Well, I'm happy, but I still wish my suicide attempts had been successful."" But I was probably the happiest I could achieve. I'm just a miserable person, but for a couple of years, I think I was not depressed. 

Now, I'm pretty much back to where I was. I've had a full-on depression relapse. I hate myself. I'm unlikeable, unlovable, I'm a bad person, I'm just defective. I can't even hold down friendships on the rare occassion I do make friends. I don't like where my life is going. I have nothing to live for. I've never been the type of person to lay in bed all day depressed. Even when I was at my worst, I still got up to do my daily routines, excelled in school and work, functioned, for all appearances, but none of it matters. I'm not working for anything. 

The one thing that keeps me from killing myself is this one thought: It won't work. The one thing that keeps me from downing pills again: It won't work. The one thing that keeps me from going upstate and getting a shotgun: It won't work. The one thing that keeps me from jumping in front of a train: It won't work. And everything will be worse after a failed attempt. I vowed never, ever, ever try to overdose again because that's a guaranteed failure. But every night for the past month or two, I fall asleep thinking about one day, finally, blowing my brains out. It's more of a guarantee, but I have to keep reminding myself that the cost of failure for that is much higher than that of overdose.I have to look at pictures of failed shotgun suicide attempts to remind myself that, even though it seems foolproof...it might not work. And everything will be worse after a failed attempt. 

 Jumping in front of a train I could do immediately, no purchase necessary, but even though it's more guaranteed than an overdose, it's less of a guarantee than a shotgun, with a horrible aftermath, and involves dragging a conductor into my death, which I don't want to do.

But I feel like, for lack of a better term, it's my destiny to kill myself. It's been part of my life for so long. It's just who I am. I've been on three different antidepressants. Right now, I'm on Effexor, and I'm thinking maybe I built up a tolerance for it and should switch medication. But what happens after that medication? The next one? And the next? And just a life time of temporary Band-Aids to cover up a life-long problem. They say suicide's a permanent solution to a temporary problem, and that might be true for some people, but not for me.

It's more of a guarantee, but I have to keep reminding myself that the cost of failure for that is much higher than that of overdose.I have to look at pictures of failed shotgun suicide attempts to remind myself that, even though it seems foolproof...it might not work. And everything will be worse after a failed attempt. Jumping in front of a train I could do immediately, no purchase necessary, but even though it's more guaranteed than an overdose, it's less of a guarantee than a shotgun, with a horrible aftermath, and involves dragging a conductor into my death, which I don't want to do. But I feel like, for lack of a better term, it's my destiny to kill myself. It's been part of my life for so long. It's just who I am. I've been on three different antidepressants. Right now, I'm on Effexor, and I'm thinking maybe I built up a tolerance for it and should switch medication. But what happens after that medication? The next one? And the next? And just a life time of temporary Band-Aids to cover up a life-long problem. They say suicide's a permanent solution to a temporary problem, and that might be true for some people, but not for me. It's not a temporary problem. It's a permanent problem.",suicide,0.36656463,0.7574432,0.1175194,0.41227573,0.6444941

This is very hard for me to write, so please look past any spelling errors. All the dates might not be 100% accurate

I'm a 18 year old guy living in Germany who is suicidal because of past and current events. I don't think my life is worth living anymore. 
Since I can think I wanted to become a professional football player. I started playing football 14 years ago. I just love football and I would always play or watch it whenever I could. I had several problems with my knee thanks to the excessive amount of work I put into my training. 3 years ago I went to the Doc because of an unusual amount of pain in my knee. Doc tells me I got cartilage damage. And I should slow down with football a bit or else I'd need surgeries which would lead to me quitting football forever. Around 1 and a half years ago I went to the Doc again to check for (yet again) an unusual amount of pain in my whole lower body parts (knees, hips, feet). Turns out that even though I visited the doc constantly he didn't think of checking my hips for damage. Not only are they misplaced but also some muscles are not properly developed (I dont know how I could play football like that). He told me I wont be able to play football ever again since it would just make my knee pain and hip pain worse. I'm no longer playing football, had to turn down an offer of a big local club in my city just because of that. Girlfriend of 2 years left me soon after I told her about it, I was completely done. 3 months later I went to Berlin with some friends to forget about all the stuff. Once I got home I got a message saying that one of my best girl friends (I had a relationship with her) got hit by a car and is in coma. I didn't know how to react at first but I eventually calmed down and kept visiting her until she passed away 1 month later (13.03.2014). I was done. I thought about suicide alot but I stayed strong for the sake of my friends and family. I stayed strong until this day. Today my father came into my room crying, I cant stand seeing my father cry so I almost started to cry too because I knew if hes crying, there is a reason to. He told me how he was a bad father and how my mom was about to divorce him if he didn't change. Hes had a hard childhood too, his mother was abusive, his father left him and when he was 23, his mother died. He said that my mother is meeting another man and how they'll divorce soon. As soon as I heard that I was done. I got on my bike and drove to some shady spot. If I'm strong enough I'll survive this night. I'm posting this to this sub-reddit because I think atleast someone needs to know what'll happen to me. I don't have the balls to tell my friends.

109601,"So uhm, someone wanted to see my songs so here (Anyways slight warning this song mentions kicking the bucket lol) [Hideous Reality]


[Verse 1]

I'm the prince of the 7 seas

I'm not hurt but I still bleed

I can't believe my life has come to this

And when I look back on the ugly past

I'll realise my existence is a sin

My life has come to this


[Pre-chorus] 

Oh, at what point will they realise

I'm not what first meets the eye?

I have more character than just my lies.

And when I finally go to bed

I hope someone comes and shoots me dead

Because my life is fixed to my lies.


[Chorus]

Oh, dear gods why on earth do I bleed?

I wish I could satisfy your needs, 

And assert dominance across the nation.

But when it comes to basic needs

My wishes are nothing more than greed.

The hideous reality breaks my hallucination.


[Verse 2]

And when the stars begin to fall

I'll think ""God damn oh is this all?

Is this my reward for pushing through my issues?""

I'm being selfish yet again

And nobody loves me the same.

Oh, now I'm crying and running outta tissues.


[Pre-chorus]


[Chorus]


[Outro thing]

And despite all the evidence

All refuses to make any sense.

My brain is scattered right across the nation.

And when I finally hit the hay

I have more character than just my lies. And when I finally go to bed I hope someone comes and shoots me dead Because my life is fixed to my lies. [Chorus] Oh, dear gods why on earth do I bleed? I wish I could satisfy your needs, And assert dominance across the nation. But when it comes to basic needs My wishes are nothing more than greed. The hideous reality breaks my hallucination. [Verse 2] And when the stars begin to fall I'll think ""God damn oh is this all? Is this my reward for pushing through my issues?"" I'm being selfish yet again And nobody loves me the same. Oh, now I'm crying and running outta tissues. [Pre-chorus] [Chorus] [Outro thing] And despite all the evidence All refuses to make any sense. My brain is scattered right across the nation.

Roman agents warned Varus that he was walking into a trap set by Arminius, but Varus refused to listen.

I asked him to get out, but he said he was bored and wanted me to entertain him. he started taking off his pants sitting closer to me. i told him to get out, but he told me just to relax adn we've already done stuff, so why not do it again. he told me to give him a blow job but i refused saying its gross and i hate it and my brother could catch us or my parents might come home. he reasoned that my parents only just left and they wouldn't be back for at least 2 hours and my brother always takes long showers. i refused the blow job and he said a hand job then, i still said no even though i've giving him one once before. he told me if i didn't give him a hand job he would tell my brother about last year on the holidays. i started to cry a bit, i felt pressured like i had no choice, my brother would be so angry and tell my parents and i would get in trouble. so i did as he said and gave him a hand job.when i stopped he asked me to give him a blow job again, i said no, he told me to take off my pants and he licked me out, while playing with my boobs. when he finished he asked me to give him a hand job again because the first one was too short and he was still horny. i said it was the last thing and he had to get out.he said he would leave after if i made him climax. I did it for what seemed like forever, i went to stop but he held my hand in place, still going up and down. after about another 10 minutes he climaxed and i asked him to leave. he said i did a good job and put his pants on and left my room. i slammed my door and cried silently in my pillow afraid my brother would hear. this is the 2nd time hes done something like this, I'm afraid he will do it again. i don't want to tell anybody cause i might get into trouble, and greg and my brother wont be friends anymore all because of me. i have no idea what the fuck to do. i want to kill myself because of what he did to me and what he made me do.

208541,"Think its timeAfter reading through this subreddit I’ve realized that people went through much more than I did and I’m just a pussy who can’t handle life. Looking at my life from the side it would seem that I have it easy; a few friends, university, family etc. But the reality is that no one really cares and I’m only needed when they need something. I was always the person who has to initiate the conversation or make plans. If i didnt do that i would be forgotten. I am 20 years old with little to no social life, I look about 14 because i am tragically underweight, the long distance relationship that i am in makes me paranoid because the girl is so far above my league its unreal. 
My teeth look like they’re throwing gang singns as my parents were more worried about alcohol than taking me to get braces, this creates major problems when communicating with other people. I try not to smile, there is not one picture of me smiling.  Even now i am typing this from an air mattress in the living room because my parents rented out the room that used to be mine. Don’t get me wrong, they have money and we never argue, they just dont care. Cant remember the last time i saw my father sober.

A few months back i decided to spend the money that i had saved up on a trip to asia, the only thought in my head when there was that i should fucking end it all. I saw a poster saying “Don’t give up” and it made me tear up. People have it much worse than me and I’m so much of a pussy that i get these thoughts when I should be happy with what I have. I am a worthless dissapointment to myself and everyone else that cared at any point. 

Every night I fall asleep with the thought of a rope around my neck going up behind my ears. I walked around the house looking for the right place to do it several times, the trees in the garden would probably be the best option. Self harm used to help in the past and take the edge off, it no longer helps. This is unfixable. I feel like I’m ill with an incurable disease that is killing me and it hurts more and more every day. I only see one way out and it honestly is a concious decision to end it all. There is absolutely no reason to carry on. Dont even know why I’m posting this because it makes it look like I’m still only considering it. I hope things get better here than they were when i was still around.",suicide,"Think its time.

Today I woke up feeling better than I had in a few days. Less achy and sore. My mom was wonderful and make me my favorite breakfast and the Chiefs won. I still feel empty. I went to watch Netflix in the other room and my mom makes a comment about putting my dog down. I visit my grandma and grandpa because they’re my favorite people on earth. I help her write an email and I feel needed but still so empty. I love her. I stay so late at her house that I can’t make it to my home at college so I have to create an outfit for dinner in what I have at home and I don’t like it. I have to do my hair and makeup with what’s there too. I came home in a hurry after I got found out I was sick. My mom and dad leave before me to get a table at the restaurant for all of us. I’m running very late. I get in my car to find my gas light is on because, even though I just got it this week, there’s a problem and my dad needed to look at it. So my mom drove it to and from work and for any errands she needs. I have to fill it up at the scary gas station and get stared down by a scary man. But I’m not scared. I’m hoping he’ll do something bad. I drive all the way to my college town and pick up my two friends. One of whom is very sweet and says “oh I totally understand why you’re late” and the other continues to make comments about me being incapable of being on time to anything. We go to dinner and I try to talk but in crowds I shut down. Nothing I have to say is worth anything anyway. My friends talk more to each other than me. After we all leave my friends continue to talk to each other more and more. They even decide to take the dog on a walk without me because they’ve my throat hurts and I wouldn’t want to come. They yell up at me that I need to move my car for a neighbor and I leave. They do not text me. They do not call. They do not ask where I went or why I went there. I finally text one of them to explain and she responds with she’s sorry but she stays. I continue to explain and she continues to stay where she is. On my birthday with a friend I introduced her to. I finally explode in a long winded text about how it’s happened to me many times that I introduce friends and then get kicked out. I tell her that her “I love you” and her “I’m sorry” doesn’t mean anything because she’s still doing the thing she’s “sorry” for. I am now selfish because I don’t want them to hang out without me. I texted my mom about this. She hasn’t respond. All of this proves to me I have no one. My grandma couldn’t wait to talk about my cousins. Or my brother’s girlfriend. Or why don’t I have a boyfriend. I chose the restaurant because my friend is celiac and she can eat their food. But I am a doormat. I do not matter. I am empty. There are moments when a flame flickers inside me but not for long before someone or something puts it out. I am 20. I have fought for 20 years. I do not want to fight for 20 more. Or 10 more.

I'm bipolar, so I know this is all bound to end, rather soon, soon being probably in 6 months at least. So it's not that I believe this is a never ending pain thing. But the depression really hurts and I'm scared I'm going to commit suicide. I don't want to actually die, I want to live and enjoy life. I don't want the ones I love to grieve, although I wish they would understand where I'm coming from, understood how bad things are. I go to work and just cry and it's so embarrassing. 

I feel like I can't trust myself. I'm afraid if I get in my car and drive I'm going to drive to where I where I want to commit it. I'm scared I'm going to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night when everyone is sleeping and commit it. I feel like I'm on the brink of doing that. I feel like this is the end and I can't imagine actually living another week or so. I feel like I want to do this and this is my destiny. I'm scared this is going to be one big impulse and I won't be able to take it back.

So I've been telling myself suicide is an active, conscious decision. It won't happen unless I decide to do it. So here are my questions, what if I /decide/ to do it, and go off to do it, how do I stop myself, what am I suppose to do? When people commit suicide, do they have a clear reason in their mind?

I see a therapist and psychiatrist. My pdoc just gave me a new anti depressant so I'm really hoping it works sooner rather than later. I do all they say to treat depression but it's not work. So yes I do exercise and all these different things a therapist would suggest. ",suicide,"Questions about Suicide. So I've been considering suicide, I have a history of that shit.

I'm in my mid 30s, and I've been convinced that life is more pain than joy for as long as I can remember.    
Even in happy periods of my life I remember thinking that not existing is a better fate than living. I have clear memories of me thinking and expressing this concept during every stage of my life.    
I only feel a strong wish to stay alive during the happiest phases of acute bliss. They're obviously pretty rare, as rare as their counterparts: the darkest peaks of depression.

Currently I'm depressed. I've been depressed for at least 4 months now. I've been depressed many times in the past too, since my teenage years. I always recovered and I believe that I'll recover this time as well. But that won't change my stance on being alive.

I'm not suicidal. Or at least I'm not going to attempt suicide anytime soon, but I wish I could. I cannot do it, because I don't want to hurt my parents, my partner and the people I love. I'd rather suffer myself and wait for a bit longer.    
Once my parents and partner are gone, I'll find a way to say goodbye to all my friends and relatives (maybe I'll say I'm becoming a hermit or joining an enclosed religious order), and will make my body disappear.    
I feel somewhat afraid of dying (and I blame my parents and society for giving me this fear). In the past the fear was stronger, but I think I'm be over it by now.

I've talked to many depressed people who feel like they're not worthy. They feel like everybody would be better off without them, and they're not worth the air they breath.    
I don't feel that way at all. I'm probably too much of a selfish person. I believe that I should have more rights than I'm given. I feel resentful towards my parents for forcing me to exist and guilting me into staying alive. I feel resentful towards society for increasing my pain; for all the injustice, unfairness, inequality, all the bullshit. I don't want to stop living to make others better: I want to do it to spare myself from the pain, frustration and annoyance that awaits us all, at times, in the future.

There's a lot of natural and unavoidable pain, sadness, anger and frustration coming and going. So many nuisances, chores and responsibilities. Tasks that I feel forced to put an effort in. Stress. Even physical paint at times. If I were not living I wouldn't feel any of that. I wouldn't feel joy or happiness either, but I'd be happy to give up all of it.    
After all, everything will come to an end anyways sooner or later. I hate this mild anxiety of unavoidable death too. I'd prefer to cut it short now.    
I'm a very lucky person. I'm well-off, healthy, loved. But that's apparently not enough to make me feel good. So many people who have worse situations feel a lot more positive towards life.

I believe that my death wish is more of a personality trait than anything else. I'd be happy to change my mind about this. I'd also be happy to feel better right now and in the future, obviously.    
I've opened up to plenty people. I've been discussing all of this with several friends. They don't seem too worried. After all I'm expressing a lucid philosophical conversation, not a hidden cry for help: I'm not suicidal currently and I'm just soberly discussing my long term plan.

Does anybody have a solution for how I'm feeling? Some words that could make me feel better or slightly move my perspective?

I know that many people have share my feelings on living: did any of you manage to change?

&amp;#x200B;

One last thing. When discussing suicide, so many people bring up emotional topics, try to scare us off, beg us to reconsider it. In many cases that's the right thing to do, like when someone wants to commit suicide over some temporary and fixable issue.    
What I'm feeling is an aspect of my personality though. Or so I believe. A helpline and some pleas wouldn't help. I'd rather discuss in a sober and lucid way about thoughts, ideas, mindset and attitude.    
I think it could also be helpful to have a pragmatic discussion about taboo topics: like what's the best way to pass away, minimizing our suffering and the suffering of our loved ones.

it's a small handgun in case it doesn't appear on the photo, as it is very dark and blurry... anyway...

Now that I look it, I feel bad, I mean, I don't  know if I'll have the courage to pull the trigger... it sucks to feel like that :/ ....  I think we were just having fun, but when I ask him to do the same, he refused :(

Sometimes when I'm feeling suicidal, I think to leave a note, but then I ask myself, Why I should?, if my friend took a photo of me while I was holding the gun, I don't think he would care if I shooted myself, neither someone would.

But well, thanks for reading, and yeah, now I'm better (thanks to the meds), but, I guess all of us thought about doing it more than once :/

 TL;DR: Friend took a pic of me while I was pointing a gun to my head, now feel bad when I see it. Thanks for reading! :)

173527,"I'm confused af I have a crush on this one girl. I've never done anything about it tho. It's been going on for 3 months now. She's 2 years younger than me (I'm 14, she 12) and she isn't in my class. For the last 3 weeks or so, this other (not my crush) girl in my class has been acting weird. She would just walk to me casually and ask me how I am, what I'm doing and that sort of shit (people don't really talk much to me, so what she did was weird af).

But today, this strange shit happened. When class ended, she walked to me and gave me this piece of paper. This was written on it:
Arctic Monkeys: 505
Arctic Monkeys - do me a favour
Arctic Monkeys - knee socks
Lonely God - Marlboro nights

As I took the paper to read it, she ran away. I think she was embarrassed, cause other kids saw that she gave it to me and started talking shit.

When I came back home, I searched this on youtube. I have already figured out it was music, but I never heard of it before. I started listening to the stuff she written there, like a completely naive bastard that I am, I never assumed that there was any meaning behind that shit. Then the last song Marlboro nights came. I was literally shaking and rolling on the floor, I was extremely shocked. Does anyone know what this is supposed to mean? What am I supposed to do now? Is this girl trying to confess to me or what?

I've actually had a crush on this girl, like 3 years ago. I even admitted that (in front of the whole class), although it might have seemed like a joke.

98255,"The best failure I've ever made (19M)I am typing this on my phone, please excuse formatting I'm trying my best. :)


Last year I graduated from high school, 365 days ago. It has amazed me how just 365 days can change so much of yourself. In that time I've gone to the maritime academy of my dreams, lost my girlfriend, and my school burnt down (long story). Seeing how much I've changed over the last year really makes me reflect on who I am, who I was, and possibly who I might become.

But, reflecting also dredges up bad memories and some

*close calls*

It was junior year of highschool when I began to not be ""in the game"", and sidelined myself in life. I had just gotten my first job that summer, and I was working my way through fall semester. I found work easy at school and would find myself on my phone to help pass the time  in class. With new rules the school district was really cracking down on phones in class and writing people up for it. Naturally as well, this didn't follow through well when I would receive detention from school and my parents would hear about it.

To me, my parents image of me was everything, it was the whole reason I worked hard in school. And when that image took a beating so did I. I was so toxic to myself about almost every little thing.

*Fucking kill yourself*
*You stupid piece of shit, can't even remember to bring a pencil*

Those were real thoughts of mine that I wrote in a sort of journal I kept during this time.

Between Thanksgiving and Christmas break I racked up 7  ""cell phone violations"", 2½ hours of detention later I ended up at home.

 First my parents took so much of my toys ( truck, phone, no bed time, had to wake up by a certain time, etc.), but what was worse was the phycological beat down I would give myself. To put it simply, it was BAD. Looking back I fear that part of myself, how bitter and heartless I could be to myself still bewilders me to this day.

I swore that if I got another detention I would kill myself. What scares me is the seriousness in the thought, I just couldn't deal with the demons in my head anymore. This was just as Christmas break began so I knew I would at least spend a ""last Christmas"" with my family to see if it was worth it to stick around.

I lasted untill January 26th, 2018.

I remember the phone call to the office, what it meant, and why I was there. I remember the clouds outside, and how the conversation with the man went in a blur. I remember the yelling, the demeaning and the embarrassment of my parents. And I remember then, the hopelessness I felt.

But then what came next was far worse

I went to school the next day and somberly went through the day, and when I got home my parents weren't.

I looked for almost an hour for some way to finish it, end it all, and rid my waste of flesh from the world.

And then it hit me,

Cars go fast and my truck had no airbags

I went back to the front door and grabbed my keys, my wallet, and a pack of fruit snacks. Just as I stepped out the door I saw my mom coming down the driveway.

In the fleeting moment of panic I dropped every plan I had for the night in fear of being labeled suicidal if I was discovered.

That night was the hardest phycological battle I've ever fought. I just couldn't stand myself anymore, so I fought back. I would write in the journal I had and furiously fight myself, pages and pages. I would fall asleep and wake up only to write more. Spilling things so vile from my mind into those pages I dare to ever read again.

But that night I scared myself terribly, I had mutilated the caustic and poisonous person I became. It was that night that I told to myself, *not yet bitch*

It took months but it got better, I re-evaluated my priorities, changed my habits, and really found myself again.

To say again in case you can't read:

 THIS TOOK MONTHS

And I am an enormously better person than that 17 year old me could've ever hoped to be. 

A friend once said to me, 

""The worst is the worst, it dosent matter how bad it is but if it's the worst you've ever seen, then it's the worst""

Everyone has their own struggles, some worse than others and I want to say and I'm also very happy to say, this was my worst. I have seen the toxicity of a mind and the betrayal of yourself. I've been there, and I'm open to talk about it. If there's something you have to share,

PLEASE DO.   
SOMEONE IS THERE, YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK.

On top of that, I'm a lesbian from an extremely homophobic family. I broke down today and started having suicidal thoughts.

219862,"Please read this (it's kinda important) Im going to start by saying that a majority of you won't be affected by this post. Im trying to speak to the vocal minority. Also these are my opinions and if you disagree with me I'm sorry.

I will talk about numerus things most of which are political and I feel like they need to be said.

1) media portrays that Christians hate the LGBT+ community and as a Christian myself I can say that that is not true. We recognize that it is a sin, say so and move on. For even if  you don't think so you are still a child of God and we shouldn't hate you for it. The people who do tie into my next point.

2) extremists suck. I don't care what group your a part of, these people are everywhere. The worst part about them is that entire groups are defined by them ( think about a ""typical"" leftist or rightist depending on what side you are on). Let's say your a liberal and you have a conservative friend you are are tight and you know he's a conservative but one day some conservative exremists bomb a liberal politician's home. You don't like conservatives and they're all evil. While this is a highly exaggerated example, how do you view the opposite side?

3) this one is more focused on this sub-reddit in particular. Some people on this sub-reddit live in tough homes and they talk about it, which is  a really good thing. It's not a perfect system though. Teenagers can say my parents slapped me and almost immediately people are like call the police or CPS or something. It's kinda the same thing as rape accusations, right? Even if they're false they ruin a man's life( I say man's because women aren't hit as hard or even at all at false rape accusations). Why? Because people judged him and continued to judge him by that. It's the same here. Parents are judged unfairly and without a way to defend themselves. So next time remember that people are innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around.

That's all I have for today and I hope you can see where I come from. I'm not the best at putting my thoughts on paper so forgive me on that front. I'll try to answer as many questions as possible to the best of my ability.

165345,"Thinking about killing myselfHi, I’m Anthony, 23 M, living in France and drunk at the moment so sorry for the gramatical mistakes I might make. 
Most of my life I’ve felt alone. I was laughed at as a kid because I used to be fat, I guess that’s why I’ve always had self confidence and trust issues. I managed to lose my virginity at 17 with a girl who loved me, I didn’t love her. I was an asshole. I guess what’s happening to me right now is karma. 
In July 2018 I fell in love with a girl that I used to work with, we were together for about 9 months and she broke up with me because of my trust issues while I was in Syria fighting. 
Since she broke up with me in May 2019 I haven’t had sex with anyone, except for a prostitute I fucked in Dubai a few months ago. In hindsight I feel like it’s a disgrace to myself, I didn’t even appreciate it.  
Since then I’ve gained a hell lot of weight, I started drinking, and spent my money on useless things. Bought myself a nice car, nice watch, nice phone,  nice clothes I that I feel unconfortable in because of the weight I took and I travel a lot, but all the money I spent brings me joy for a moment and then the saddness fills me again. 
I feel like I’m going to stay alone my whole life and this thought is horrible to bear. I’m someone who needs to be with someone. 
I used to be in love with my best girl friend, I guess I still am. I see her as the epitome of the best woman I could be with. I know I can never be with her, she didn’t like me back 7 years ago, what’s changed now? 

These times I keep thinking about suicide, I can’t deal with this loneliness. I don’t feel like comitting suicide right now, but the thought is getting more and more present.

223822,"A mental health professional who cannot benefit from mental health professional helpDebate
I like debating.  There’s a rush, a thrill to using logic and reason to being able to have your point upheld without question of its validity by yourself and your peers.  I stand to reason that, through logic and reason, I could be wrong in my assessment of my situation.

I’ve been working in the mental health profession for almost 15 years.  I have talked more people out of suicide and going down the dark alleys of regret and heartache than I can count.  Besides a small handful of cases, I’ve succeeded on these counts and I take my duty to this world, and for me, my God, seriously. I was meant to do this job.

I have had my bouts of suicide in the past long ago.  I’ve been hospitalized for it as well.  I have had a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder. It was treated for many years however, with the help of psychiatrist, therapy, and prayed, I was able to be taken off my medication - utilizing coping skills, understanding of my triggers (in particular my mania triggers), and a strong support system of family (my parents and siblings) and church.

I’ve been married for nearly a decade now. I have three children with fairly big age ranges.  I can’t get into too much detail because this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I’m also looked at a leader in my field: I’m a director of a psychiatric facility.  I have a post graduate degree and am currently working towards my doctorates; however, that is on pause at the moment due to my commitment to my facility during this pandemic.

Despite the degree of respect and hospitality I receive in my field; my home life is another story.  I am the sole provider yet expected to still ensure food is cooked (I either cook or I waste money on fast food), the kids are being taken cared of, house is maintained to a certain degree, bills are paid, etc etc etc.  I have little to no respect from my wife, and to agree my own children.  I am not allowed to listen to certain music or watch certain shows or movies without a degree of criticism from my wife who assumes if I have time for those things I should either do something around the house, spend time with her, or spend time with the children so that she can play video games or watches whatever she wants to.  She watches whatever she wants to be my selection of music and movies are questioned. If I’m in a seclusive mood, my entrainment selections are to be blamed for bringing in “bad spirits”.  Or I’m bringing in “bad spirits” from work and not praying or reading the Bible enough.

I’ve tried to leave my wife recently.  I had a glimpse of a life I could have had: I had a nice apartment ready for me, friend and family who have essentially kept at a long distance embraced me and told me that they would be there for me, I pictured being able to care of my children without arguments in the house, with structure, with the upbringing of family meals, chores and a clean home, and activities together that I know they will enjoy in an environment where the mood of the house is not fixed upon the mood of a single person.  This was only a glimpse and this world came crashing down.

Without her working, it would appear that almost 60-70% of my income would go to her - even with the children custody being 50/50.  This according to her lawyer (my lawyer I had vetted appeared to just tell me whatever it took for me to drop the money for the huge retainer).  I would essentially be working for her and barely be able to live in my apartment, which I didn’t mind at first but the cost kept increasing and my available funds kept decreasing.  Then the schools closed for fall making the lives of my children more strained and uncertain.  Both her and myself would need to move into small apartments and it would be hard on my children taking on so many changes in such a short time.  

So we decided to have me move back in (I was staying with a friend) and we would work it out.  I was seeing a pastor about the issue who advised me to fight for my marriage.  I set terms of what I felt would be fair for this marriage and our roles in the household.  I said I think we should sleep in the same room (I’ve been on the couch since January), she should help pay the bills, help with groceries, and help put dinner on the table.  Chores should be divided in the household to everyone to help relieve the burden.  We should communicate and talk more. I wanted a marriage therapist (as I’ve always wanted one) but it didn’t seem like that demand would be acquiesced.

Any slight I make, any time I disagree with her decision or her views (her views are 5G towers are evil, vaccines are bad, Trump is good, coronavirus is blown out of proportion for the new world order, money-less society is for the new world order, etc.) then I’m not praying enough and am being too worldly.  (All her views, by the way, are the opposite of mine).

Last week her nephew had a birthday party (they live in my house so this was okay with the pandemic).  She screamed at me for forgetting the rice and beans from the store. She didn’t like how I looked when she screamed at me about it. Throughout the day, she was mad, apologized, mad again, apologized, etc. etc. etc.  There’s no point in analyzing her behaviors because she will refuse to get any treatment anyways, even if she agrees with certain things (like having PMDD, she only wants natural remedies which she doesn’t stick with).

Something occurred to me that day, I made up my mind to commit suicide.  I’ve thought about all the ways I could reason myself out of it but no argument held up:

1. It’s selfish - so is being forced to live ONLY in the service of others.
2. My children - this is a good reason NOT to commit suicide but the fights they see, the look of defeat on my face has got to be damaging as well. I lost my father at an early age and it hurt during that period but was able to still achieve what I’ve been able to.
3. My family - my mother will be devastated, yes, as will my brothers who have their own mental health issues themselves (but are doing very well in their own fields).  I hope that knowing I’m not suffering anymore of feeling inadequate, lost, pitiful, and depressed can be a consolation of sorts.
4. My salvation - I’ve already begun praying everyday for God to forgive me for these thoughts and what I’m planning on doing.

Now; the number one reason I haven’t killed myself yet is a big one: pain.  I don’t want to feel pain.  The reason I don’t want to feel pain is because I don’t want to change my mind at the last minute and then suffer from disfigurement or brain damage. I want to start it and finish it.  I’ve had one, what I would consider, real suicide attempt already in my life. I know, statistically speaking, the next one has a greater chance of success and the subsequent one does not.  So I need to make sure the method I do is going to fulfill my desires in this endeavor: painless, somewhat quick without the chance of having my mind changed, and a high degree of lethality.

I know the science behind the methods. I know that my body can even unconsciously fight off any attempts at ending my life.  I don’t own a gun yet so I cannot use that method. Hanging is my preferred method and I’m still doing research on the TOR network of ways to make it painless with different drug cocktails, etc.

Before I die I also want to make a journal writing the way I wish my life was: a sort of way to life my life without having to wait and live it or the obstacles I’m currently experiencing.  I love to write.  Before I got into the medical field, it was what I wanted to do the most.  I figure I can write about life that I wanted to suffice my cravings for what could have been.

In the end, I don’t know what to do with how I’m feeling.  I’m positive for Covid-19 and have been suffering from chest pains.  I was positive after I made the final decision to see to it that I end my life. I was hoping this would lead to my death instead.  I have been downplaying the effects of the virus in hopes that without medical attention I can die in my sleep. I’m already taking the proper precautions at home to protect my family.  I’m also passed the suicide clause of my life insurance so my children should qualify for a handsome payout.  Also the SSI checks they should receive on top of that should help as well along with anything else my wife will qualify for, she can sustain this lifestyle they have for at least 2-3 years which is plenty of time before she finishes nursing school and gets a job.

I tried to see a therapist but couldn’t find any in this pandemic climate that takes my insurance, and, quite frankly, it’ll be a waste. I know what they will say. I know the tricks of the trade and how to navigate the misguided  “rationalizations” of suicide.  I know that theirs light at the end of the tunnel.  I know that leaving my wife would make all of this better.  But it comes at too great of a cost; not to mention the times she said she would call my work, embarrass me, and try to get my license taken away at all costs.  So what life is there for me? I’ve alienated my friends and family by going back to her - whom she wants me to have as little contact with as possible due to their support of our divorce earlier.  I would lose my job, my career, my calling.  I would essentially be working for her and if I lost my job I wouldn’t be making enough.  My kids already think very little of me for not sticking up for myself in my house but it’s hard when you’re up against someone who is willing to play chicken with a tank; who’s willing to see everything burn and not flinch.  How do you compete against that?

If this virus doesn’t kill me, I’m going to have difficult time finishing the job but I won’t give up.  She’s always saying I always leave things unfinished.  This is one job I want to complete.

I'm a very abstract thinker (I don't have an inner monologue) but I distinctly think the words ""I want to kill myself"" whenever I see a picture of myself or think about something I've done.

I don't really think I'll kill myself but I do fantasize about being *gone.* My parents would be okay -- or not, but maybe then they'd feel bad for making me this way. My brother and his partner would be better off. My friends from my hometown and my friends from uni would probably be temporarily upset. But, they'd know at least-- how depressed I was. Maybe then they would forgive me for everything I've done and realize it was just because I am a fundamentally *off* person. My boyfriend would probably be traumatized but he'd be better off in the long run. He could finally be with one of the girls he has desired while we've been together.

My family still struggling, my finance is worse now that im in debt, governments dont care, people dont care. Friends is a word used wrong in europe, back home a friend is someone you can trust, talk to, offload stress and they do the same, but in EU your friend takes but never gives. I have a list of atleast 2000 things i can say about europe and life in europe but its not what im here for... I have reached the end of the line, theres nothing to say do or take that will change my mind. I have experimented everything to see what will help with depression, but found nothing, I left africa to help my family members, but since i left all i see is deaths of loved ones,  illnesses and debts that my family didnt have before. I tried to help but theres nothing I can do. I recently opened a Bitcoin account, this is for me to pay money into for my family but now I cant, after today i cant. Like i said, this is the end, im done with this life, the racism, the hate, debts, problems, I cant take any of that. So **24/09/2020 at 17:00 ES**T I will no longer exist, if you want to donate to my family after im gone then heres the address:

Friends is a word used wrong in europe, back home a friend is someone you can trust, talk to, offload stress and they do the same, but in EU your friend takes but never gives. I have a list of atleast 2000 things i can say about europe and life in europe but its not what im here for... I have reached the end of the line, theres nothing to say do or take that will change my mind. I have experimented everything to see what will help with depression, but found nothing, I left africa to help my family members, but since i left all i see is deaths of loved ones, illnesses and debts that my family didnt have before. I tried to help but theres nothing I can do. I recently opened a Bitcoin account, this is for me to pay money into for my family but now I cant, after today i cant. Like i said, this is the end, im done with this life, the racism, the hate, debts, problems, I cant take any of that. So **24/09/2020 at 17:00 ES**T I will no longer exist, if you want to donate to my family after im gone then heres the address: 3Qtbf4Q6Swbo42bb6A8j. Je. EFVMATDXTn. Vw you might think why would he put a bitcoin address before he dies, thats because after I die no one will be taking care of my parents, or my siblings or the rest of the family. I want to leave, I made my mind up. I just dont want to leave my family without anything.",suicide,0.660604,0.24128266,0.4549814,0.40364555,0.5414749

But finally I'm calm about it and im....fine with it.


I know I will hurt people with my decision. Family and Friends. But I have been fighting depression for more than a decade now and it's a disease with no cure. Not enough people take it seriously enough to challenge this disease for a cure or solution.


Not enough people care. Just enough people care to feel validated in thinking they've done something to help. It hasn't been enough yet. 
Just like world hunger....polution....not enough has changed. Maybe one day, those who suffer with our disease will find a cure for it. Then no one will feel this empty.


I hope No one will get to this point of being ok with killing themselves. No one will have to lie and say they're fine when they aren't. No one will fake  a smile to hide their pain because others choose not to listen.

One day.

Someone will say they're fine....and it will be true.


But not for me. I am empty. I am tired. I am too far gone. To broken to believe that anything or one can help me. And that's ok. I'm at peace with this.. 
I'm finally at peace with what I am.

If someone reads this. There is hope for you. Fight the good fight. Do not end up like me. And help those who feel as if the light has burned out....help them. Please.






Tonight I'm going to watch one last movie. Cause I love movies. Then I'm going to sleep. And drift off into eternity. Into all the different realities I have created for myself during times of sorrow and pain. When reality got too tough these were the worlds in my mind I would escape too.

216704,"2020 Political Conversion is Killing Me 

Ever since I developed my mental illness which was brought into existence by my substance abuse, I have harassed, derided, and intimidated countless strangers and friends. Now that it is 2020, and it seems like it's the end of the world, I am examining myself. I am a sinner. I am not any deity or special person. But I am a closeted Trump supporter, but this fact DOES NOT make me a racist.   
I traveled to Japan in 1999 to experience the millennium on my sixteenth birthday.  It was then that I became obsessed with the internet and everything to do with gamer culture. These games I played made me feel more powerful than I ever would by just doing drugs. Combining drugs, alcohol, and video games has practically ruined my life.  
This is not a proper suicide note. I am not man enough to kill myself and have been goading everyone I know into trying to attack, kill, or maim me. I am trying to become depressed enough to end it all, but the closest I got was going blind for five seconds after being very briefly paralyzed from taking too many anti-psychotic drugs.  
Jesus Christ is Lord, and I am but a worthless wretch who had the audacity to think I understood all faiths and mythologies. I am no prophet. I am scum, but not the human kind.   
I am asexual and plan to be single for life. I want my life to mean something. Today is my tenth day sober and I feel strengthened.  
I can breathe again, without a CPAP machine, with all thanks given to our first respond-er who came to rescue me even when there was NOTHING at all wrong with me. I racked up an astronomical medical bill and caused countless headaches for my doctors, peers, family, and friends.   
I am desperately trying to find a way to get depressed enough to end my life, but I cannot overcome the happiness I feel from taking my medication and getting my Invega-sustenna shot (monthly.)  
I just want to say thank you to the store that let me buy alcohol over a thousand times (if not more).   
I know my family, acquaintances, and friends have been worried for me. But I can't go on any longer. If I am to continue on living, I want to earn every dollar myself, through my own blood, sweat, and tears. And in President Trump's America, there may be a snowballs chance in hell that I finally do get a job and stop being a parasite.  
I can wish. But I can't make miracles happen. It's true, I'm forsaken. Antifa can keep their guillotine ready for me. I stand for nothing, and do not deserve to live in this beautiful city.

As it is, things did not turn out well but still...at the time...there was a chance then!

First off, my oldest brother (32M) wrote me off for good last year because he asked me to give his ex girlfriend’s belongings back to her. He would do this a lot, and one time he asked I didn’t have the time (I was a caregiver and had a 12hr shift). He told me that since he co-signed for my car that I should’ve had his back, and said I wasn’t family.

My two other brothers (26M) (24M) live with him and are basically sheep, and took his side. I found out that the 24 y/o actually agreed with me, but didn’t have the guts to say anything.

50758,"To people against TikTok hear me out I know TikTok is seen as cringe and creepy, which to be honest it can be and at times is, but there are a lot of positives that come with it. Before I get torched let me explain. I’m a “content creator” on 2 smaller accounts, both under 50k with a popular localized fan base. I don’t do no dancing cringe or whatever. TikTok as a platform has opened up a variety of opportunities for me. I’ve been offered business opportunities, have met amazing people who I consider to be friends now, and it put me in the position to make a positive impact on those in my community which I cared about the most. I know it’s fun and easy to pick on the app, and trust me I do it too, but if this app just gets banned a lot of people are losing something that has changed and is changing their life to an extent. Literally yesterday I talked with a local company and got an ambassador deal that will give me pay per video I post regarding the company and my own sign up code. This company would put more people in my community back to work after their jobs were lost during the start of the Covid-19 shutdown, and would be able to help those during the impending shut down (of at least my state). I don’t mean to white knight TikTok or defend it like a 12 year old but I’m just tryna show some people that despise it that the app has a decent amount of positives for those who use it.

And regarding the app stealing information: the app is sketchy with that I completely agree and that’s why I’m pretty sure they announced that they were moving towards it being a US app (not completely but expanding it to please the government, it’s on TikTok’s TikTok page lol). I’m going to be honest tho, my safety concerns about data being stolen are dead after reading through some articles about US apps and Snowden’s stuff. I know that it’s China the data is going to but the US government in our allies (probably) have my info anyways.

In conclusion: If TikTok gets banned that’s an ouchie to me and others, but it’d still be funny to watch the dancers scramble to YouTube and Twitter.

In a single moment I have the ""greatest"" idea to say:

""I'm bouta take the biggest shit in this bitch.""

....out loud, to whoever was in the stall.

But I decided not too.

And then my science teacher, who was my next class, walked out. 

She's a really nice teacher. One of the greatest ones ever. But considering how small and prestigious my school was, I would have been in a lot of trouble if I went through with the joke. Ah, the joys of going to a Gifted Magnet School run by Liberal LGBTQ+ supporters.

154321,"The void can only be filled by the sweet release of death.My girlfriend of 2 years dumped me. Ever since I first saw her, I was head over heels. Her beautiful platinum blonde hair dances through my mind all day. 
I couldn’t keep my feelings bottled up any longer, so I told our mutual friend. Touched by my shyness and fondness of the love of another, she told my love.

The next day, as I walk through the gates of our school, my love runs to me; exclaiming that she feels the same way.

But all good things must come to an end.

We were sent to two different high schools. Our love continued online, occasionally meeting up face-to-face.

My love told me about a couple of boys at school who made fun of her, they’d exclaim preposterous nonsense about how she shouldn’t be allowed to like Pokémon, dinosaurs or video games in general as she is a girl. 
I told her, “to hell with them! You are beautiful, so naturally they be jealous. Don’t let them get to you.”

After a few weeks, we rarely spoke. Soon enough, not at all.

I was sat at my computer, playing a game. No one really spoke to me, so I always kept my phone near me; hoping My friends will want to speak to me.
I get the text nobody wants to get.
“Hello, I just texting to say that.. I wanna break up.”

My heart sank as I read those words. They rang in my head.
I had to rush away, cowering in my bed. I wouldn’t allow my family to see my tears.
I read on, more and more tears falling. “I’m not trying to hurt you, I’m just doing  this for me.”

“Those goddam bullies” I thought. “I would be tried for murder if I ever crossed paths with those bastards.” 
With our conversation cut short, all I could do was cry. In the next week, i almost killed myself 3 times. In the end, I couldn’t do it.

It has been two months since that happened. With that, my innocence being stolen, living with MDD and being on several medications is too heavy on me.

Lately people have told me “you’re doing so good!”, “you seem happier then normal!” “Hey you’re coping so well!”. It makes my anger shriek; bellowing endlessly.

 Now, I’m sacrificing me getting better. 

I’ve stopped taking my medication, I’ve deleted most of my friends off everything and I’m forcing a smile 24/7. No one will see my death coming. well, you will. And so will the driver of the car.

The void in my heart is growing. I Yearn for it to be filled with the love of my sweet Love.

I hope she forever feels it was her fault. 
I hope they all cry before my still, cold body.
I hope they cry forever so that they may feel the void that once thrived in my heart. 
The void can’t be filled. That’s the realization I reached early on.

last night we were on the phone after not getting to talk much that day. i start asking him about his day and out of nowhere he just starts going off about how corona is ''just the flu'' and that if my sister got it that it wouldn't be that big of a deal... even if my sister got a fever because of how weak her immune system they would have to do a spinal tap on her. for those of you who don't know what a spinal tap is thats where they stick a big needle all the way through your skin and into your spine. it is extremely painful and traumatic for even adults. 

this pandemic has taken 6 months of my life that i can never get back. but the only thing that is keeping me going is knowing that me sacrificing my mental health and isolating for 6 months is at least protecting my sister. and he really has the nerve to say that i am doing all of this for nothing. he kept yelling at me that i ''don't understand the human immune system''. he REALLY has the nerve to say that when he can't even spell some 4 letter words and he learned anatomy from an anime.... 

he even makes his mom call my mom every time they go out to try to ''convince her'' to let me go out with them. my family is doing exactly what the doctors told us to do and they can't respect that in the slightest. 

his family gave up on quarantine after 1 month. he goes wherever he wants and sees whoever he wants. and he rubs his freedom in my face. he has asthma so he still has a big risk for the virus but he doesn't care. he doesn't care who he would infect if he gets it. when i bring this up to him he just says ''yeah i like to live on the edge'' and laughs. ITS NOT A JOKE   

i have been nothing but kind to him. i watch him streaming video games for hours even though i hate it. i always give him what he wants. i always ask him about his day. i do what he wants me to. i show him my body even if i don't want to. i stay in the call with him even when he's literally ignoring me. i try everyday to be the best i can be for him. and he just picks me apart

even if he is right and it has no risk. i cannot control whether i leave my house or not. my parents do. bringing up this ''covid is not that bad'' crap is not going to help me in the slightest. it just made me feel even worse. why would you do that to someone you love?",non-suicide,i need relationship advice *for some context before i begin i should mention that my mom just gave birth to my beautiful babysitter that just turned 1 month old. she has no immune system. because of the pregnancy being at the same time as the pandemic quarantine has been so so hard on us. i haven't seen him in 6 months. and because my mom has ocd she won't even let me go in our backyard. i haven't left my neighborhood in 6 months. it's been incredibly hard.* last night we were on the phone after not getting to talk much that day. i start asking him about his day and out of nowhere he just starts going off about how corona is ''just the flu'' and that if my sister got it that it wouldn't be that big of a deal... even if my sister got a fever because of how weak her immune system they would have to do a spinal tap on her. for those of you who don't know what a spinal tap is thats where they stick a big needle all the way through your skin and into your spine. it is extremely painful and traumatic for even adults. this pandemic has taken 6 months of my life that i can never get back. but the only thing that is keeping me going is knowing that me sacrificing my mental health and isolating for 6 months is at least protecting my sister. and he really has the nerve to say that i am doing all of this for nothing. he kept yelling at me that i ''don't understand the human immune system''. he REALLY has the nerve to say that when he can't even spell some 4 letter words and he learned anatomy from an anime.... he even makes his mom call my mom every time they go out to try to ''convince her'' to let me go out with them. my family is doing exactly what the doctors told us to do and they can't respect that in the slightest. his family gave up on quarantine after 1 month. he goes wherever he wants and sees whoever he wants. and he rubs his freedom in my face. he has asthma so he still has a big risk for the virus but he doesn't care. he doesn't care who he would infect if he gets it. when i bring this up to him he just says ''yeah i like to live on the edge'' and laughs.

I had been having this urge to take them and see what happens, but didn't logically want to, and then I was reading a book, stopped and 10 seconds later was holding it. I had to fight myself to put them down. I feel like I am in a battle with myself, and each self destructive or suicidal thought takes so much energy to push down that I am getting tired.

26174,"So I've been exercising in I think the most unhealthy I can... So at just the start, no, I don't use drugs or steroids or have anorexia, I'm talking mentally, so with that outta the way, let's get on with it. (P.S info for the story, I'm competitive, 14, year 10 and I have a long distance girlfriend I've been with for almost 10 months and I use way too many commas so please forgive me)

So I'm British, and my school is right next to the Thames, this means we rowing as a sport. Throughout year 7 and 8, I always wanted to row, so when year 9 rolled around, and I was finally the minimum age I could be, I jumped right into it.

I was never an athletic kid, hell no, I wasn't fat, I was unpopular, not stand out, and to put it simply, below average in grades, physically and probably in terms of mental health too. I was very unpopular, being the first kid to hit puberty (at 11 to 12) so I was taller than others, but still physically very unfit. Now one thing that got me into rowing was that fact. I was tall. At 13 I was approaching 6 foot, and fast. One thing they don't tell you about ergo machines, is that height matters, A LOT. I instantly got one of the best scores in the year and then it began, I was launched from the background, right into the spotlight. I was suddenly madly competitive, and (mildly) popular and I wanted to be the best. So I was. Throughout all of year nine I ground my body as hard as I could to have the body I wanted. Our year was also the year where the Thames was overflowing our dock quite a bit, we had about 6 sessions in the entire year on the water, the rest on the machines. My body was exhausted, but I wasn't, eventually, nearing the end of the year, I managed to pull a 1:39 split on 500 metres. This was a BIG deal. I'd beat my goal, I beat 500 metres in less than 100 seconds, 99.7 to be exact. My first ever time took 125 seconds, over a fifth higher.

I was the top of the leaderboard all day every day, and my confidence showed it, I felt like a king. Then Covid happened.

Immediately, I had a problem, my gym wouldn't let me in even with no lockdown cause I'm under 16, and I had no ergo, so we had to get one. A concept 2 was preferred, as it's industry standard. Cut 2 weeks into the future and I've nearly lost 200 quid of my dad's money to a scam of a concept 2, but i have the new RW 900 NordickTrack Rowing Machine delivered by the lovely Amazon. Good? Great. I was back.
But then Covid stayed, my motivation slipped, and I became lazy, I was a tragedy if you ever saw one, I was doing barely anything and my body was paying for it, I was slipping from day to day of online school, feeling awful and having my body go down in quality all the while. But I got on with it, I got back into it and I pushed my body past my limit until I got back. So I feel great going back, I grin to my friends as I mount the ergo and prepare to brake another of my records, at the front of the pack, in my arena, I felt unstoppable... My score was below average, pitiful considering how i was, and way below what I wanted, expected, and needed to be in the top boat. By now the sport consumed me, but rejected me, I was getting mediocre scores and everyone else was soaring. Cut about a month and I'm kicked from top boat. (Just realized writing this - forgot to say - I was a year 10 when I came back, and we had a new coach, she hates me) She kicks me from top boat and I'm crushed, shaking from disappointment in myself, and suddenly I'm pushed back into the background, I didn't matter once again, I was paired with the people who wouldn't focus, but in boats with people never having rowed before.

Wanna know the worst bit? I could see the top boat speeding away from us any time I looked to my right, we were finally on the river, and this is how it was. Now we're in lockdown again, and I'm determined, I can't let that happen again, or so I think, right before I get on the ergo once more and feel a painful rash spread across my whole body. So it turns out for a few months I've had a condition where whenever my blood gets to hot or something (that's when it effects me worst), I break out into a rash) I was struggling once more, thinking it was just hayfever. I struggled through each session, it got worse and worse. I now have medication, an antihistamine to be exact, fexofenadine hydrochloride, to stop it. Great, back to it. So my school is private, and most of the kids have mansions, and one guy I know has a gym the size of most of my house, so I'm at a disadvantage competitively, and I've been doing this for one 1 and a half years, when these people have been swimming competitively in their pools for most of their lives. But I got too it, and I'm getting better with my body, and I'm getting better scores, until there it is, my name. My name in gold, I got the fastest score for a 2 kilometre race in the year. Remember how I said Concept 2s are industry standard? Well that means my coach (who once again, dislikes me) had to change my scores to be accurate. To do this, I sent her my average watts produced per 500 metres, a measurement which adds with to my score in a concept 2 conversion to 1:49 per 500 metres, and I did it in 6:13 (the 2km) this doesn't add up if you check, since it's just an average watt count, but the timer didn't lie, I'd done it.

This did not matter. A split second in a race does. And so does my split score. As I said before, I beat 500 in 99.7 seconds. My coach added 20 seconds to every split I did from my home ergo, and my name was wiped from the leaderboard, no matter what the watt count said. I was pushed, forced, back down, I went from the best score to one of the worst. Now 20 seconds is a LOT of time, and that's for each 500 metres, so instead of my original score, I was forced to put up with a score of 7:33. 80 seconds slower than the original. So now what do I know? I can't beat anything at home now, I can simply train my body for when I go back, to be best again. The 20 seconds thing was 2 weeks ago (about). As I mentioned, I have a girlfriend, she's incredible, we don't see each other much and we mostly text, and she was getting concerned about the strain I've been putting on my body. But I've been insecure about everything for too long, I can't handle not getting back up there, I need it, I crave it, I was born to row, I know it. So I've been doing the worst thing I can.

I've lied to her. Multiple times. I say I'm going to bed, but I stay up, going as hard as I physically can, no longer bound by my condition. Even as I write this, it's 1 AM and she thought I went to sleep at 11. I need help, I can't stop, I can't keep doing this to her, I feel terrible. My body is sore and aching, and I can't lie to her anymore, it's awful. I need suggestions on what to do, I can't put her through me complaining more and more, I can't stay down in rowing and I need to get back up. I'm ready to row again.

About 2 years ago, when I was throwing a party for my 16th birthday (nothing big, I always only invite a handful of friends, we go on some activity (this time it was an escape room) and then we'll return for games, gifts and cake) a friend, a very good friend that I knew since I was 11 or 12, who happens to be a girl, gifted me a single red rose. The 'main' present was also great, it was a 30€ gift card for a comic book store if I remember correctly. 

Because the internet gave me conflicting answers, I never knew what that meant. And I sure as hell was not going to ask anybody about that. Until yesterday. I asked my mom, who told me that the meaning of a rose depends on its color. A white rose means apology, a pink rose means friendship and a red rose means love. 

I was baffled. If that's really true, I was missing signs that a smart, funny and ngl quite good looking girl was hitting on me. As I havn't been in a lot of relationships it wouldn't surprise me to be oblivious in the ways of love. 

A few months before my birthday, however, she switched schools and the introvert that I am, we lost contact at some point.

I am still confused and a little angry about myself. I feel dumb and I thought that I might as well ask Reddit. I don't know whether I should go and try to get to the bottom of this, or whether I am overthinking this.

61524,"A serious post on pedophilia and loli hentai. With this post i want to share and discuss my opinion (Which i recently discovered is quite controversial) that pornography such as loli hentai, that depicts minors without being actually child porn, should not be prohibited and do no damage to society. Allow me to explain.  
Pedophilia is a mental condition that, like any other sexual orientation, cannot be changed. I believe pedophiles should seek psychological help, in order to ensure they don't ever have relations with a minor, but I also believe pornography for them should exist as long as it doesn't involve real children being used. I believe this because it has been proven that countries and societies where porn consumption is common rape happens much less: It is logical that a person who is sexually frustrated will be much more propense to rape if they don't have a way of relieving sexual stress such as masturbation. The same applies with pedophiles: A pedophile who relieves sexual tension through masturbation is much less propense to ever abuse of a child than one who accumulates sexual desire with no way to relieve it.

Now, I don't understand how so many people disagree with this. It seems so clear to me that this pornography, no matter how disgusting it can be to us non-pedophiles, helps prevent actual children from being abused. That's why I make this post, to discuss this with people who think otherwise.

I am not a pedophile. Quite opposite: my life has been greatly affected by pedophilia. That is why I want it to happen as little as possible, and I believe this is a way to do so.",non-suicide,"A serious post on pedophilia and loli hentai.

338281,"CurrentlyI need to write everything down; I hope that it is okay to do it here. So, on Wednesday morning, it finally felt like life had settled down for a moment. I was busy, but it felt good, and it kept my mind off of too much anxiety or suicidal ideation. Of course, that couldn't last for long. That evening, my school sent out an opportunity letter to all students concerning auditions for the local boys school's production (the female roles). From then on, my life became unbearable again.

I desperately wanted to be in it, but I knew I did not have the time to invest unless I was a significant role (I didn't want to dedicate months to just being in the ensemble. I am alright at acting, but not necessarily suited for that part; however, after a couple panic attacks, I finally had the courage to write down my name the next morning.

On Thursday, everything was once again settling down in a way. I planned to find a monologue that night and start practicing for next week. Once again, however, I began to panic because my classmate insisted that the role involved singing. Everything felt hopeless again. I couldn't catch a break. And so, another panic attack ensued.

That night was even worse though. On the list, many more girls had suddenly also signed up for the main role; one, particularly, is not only an amazing actor, but also absolutely perfect for that part. I was so weak and filled with anxiety that I cried and hyperventilated for an hour when I saw her name. I knew I had no shot at all, which I guess I knew all along. This just confirmed it.

I need to write everything down I hope that it is okay to do it here. So, on Wednesday morning, it finally felt like life had settled down for a moment. I was busy, but it felt good, and it kept my mind off of too much anxiety or suicidal ideation. Of course, that couldn't last for long. That evening, my school sent out an opportunity letter to all students concerning auditions for the local boys school's production (the female roles). From then on, my life became unbearable again. I desperately wanted to be in it, but I knew I did not have the time to invest unless I was a significant role (I didn't want to dedicate months to just being in the ensemble. I am alright at acting, but not necessarily suited for that part however, after a couple panic attacks, I finally had the courage to write down my name the next morning. On Thursday, everything was once again settling down in a way. I planned to find a monologue that night and start practicing for next week. Once again, however, I began to panic because my classmate insisted that the role involved singing. Everything felt hopeless again. I couldn't catch a break. And so, another panic attack ensued. That night was even worse though. On the list, many more girls had suddenly also signed up for the main role one, particularly, is not only an amazing actor, but also absolutely perfect for that part. I was so weak and filled with anxiety that I cried and hyperventilated for an hour when I saw her name. I knew I had no shot at all, which I guess I knew all along. This just confirmed it.

31723,"Death and Pain, I canʻt take it anymoreHello...internet
I am one of your average teenagers who has access to the internet. Cool, I know.
I am here because I have been thinking about death and if touching it would help me. You see, I have a pretty fucked up life at this point. I basically have everything a kid could need in life, but for some reason there is shit wrong with me. I used to be good, smart kid who did his hw and didnʻt think thrusting myself with a knife. My last memory of ""the good days"" was in 4th grade. Towards the end of the year, I remember just not really doing my school work. Being lazy...

I made it through. 5th grade was where I started falling apart. Constantly not turning in work, and not caring. I had a bad teacher who had it out for me which led to many teacher parent conferences and my dad staring him down. Notice that part. My dad stared him down because that teacher treated me like an outcast and he actually cared. I have parents that care but me, I just fk up every single opportunity that is given to me.

Something I guess is worth noting is that I am not actually stupid. In my state I scored in the top hundred or so kids in subjects like Mathematics, English and Science. This confused teachers as my ability to turn in work didnʻt match with my test scores.

This basically has been repeating itself since then. After 5th I went to an online school, and that is when things got worse. Because now you could work on your schedule and not the teachers. I did ok 6th grade, but 7th and 8th grade I did little to no work. But somehow when it came to quarter and semester ends, I scraped up Aʻs and Bʻs because of my intellect but not my work ethic. 

Now here I am, a sophmore in highschool. I basically screwed up my freshman year, I let my grades slip and I no longer able to slip by with Aʻs and Bʻs as well as I was. Because the work got harder, and guess what, I was in a damn private school. Yes my parents were spending almost 20k for me to do next to nothing. 

I donʻt know what to do at this point. You guys can think ""Oh this kid just isnʻt doing good in school""...no

Iʻm a social outcast, and I have basically no friends. I canʻt even call them friends because all I can talk to them about is the video games we both play. Iʻve been over there house once or twice but Iʻm basically alien to them. I skip basically half of the quarter, not going to school, doing nothing and wasting away. Just being...nothing. I am not going anywhere in life and I canʻt muster anything to pick myself up and get out of this pit. 

Also, last year I lost the person who mattered the most to me. She had been my friend since middle school...those close friends that you share 99.9% of yourself with, the other 0.01% being that you actually like them, in that other way. When we finally sad those words and became something more, things were...amazing. I still rememberr the day, and how the tears fell from my face and how I thought how could someone feel this way about me with how fked up I am....

and you know what

She died.

I lost her

I lost the person who... who meant so much to me...

and I just canʻt deal with this anymore. She is the one who helped push me when I couldnʻt. She helped me, she made me want to be better. If it werenʻt for her, Iʻd be worse off. 

You might ask, where is my family in this? Well my sisters go to a private school as well. They are the girls that everyone loves and they are social butterflies that have like 3 sports and 50 clubs so they were busy enough. My dad is consumed by his work day and night, and any slim time in between. My mom, she...she is in a dark place as well and she has even talked about killing herself as well, in front of the family.

I canʻt take it anymore. How I threw everything away, and how I could have so easily fixed it because of my intellect and the chances people gave me. They saw me, and they said what I had been hearing for years.

Potential

But I waste it, I donʻt do anything. I try to break the cycle, I really do try but I canʻt I canʻt.....

I just fall again and I try to get back up and the worst part is, Iʻm the person who knocks myself down again and drags myself deeper. 

I donʻt know what to do. I have a shit ton of school work to do, tests and exams to study for. But Iʻm ready to just give up. I hate it, I despise being this weak but Iʻm just tired of living like this...

Iʻll miss the few friends I had. The few...

and the beauty of the shes and hers with whom I was entranced, it will be sad to never again, upon that, glance...",suicide,"Death and Pain, I cant take it anymore.

25471,"Christian schools suck There are about 3 things a Christian school can be. 1: A small, dirty, cheap church school that forces the ideas of the church on you. 2: A ‘Christian’ school that is really just there for sports purposes. 3: a decent place to learn

I have spent my entire life in these Christian schools, and I have seen enough. I spent so much of my life in a small, confined, isolated church school, that I didn’t know anybody outside of my school. So when I switched schools for high school, (which is Christian by the way, and is the fourth option) so I didn’t have friends for my first year out of the hellhole of my old school. Sure, I knew people, but now I am getting closer to people, and I’m happy about that. 

Now let’s talk about those small, cheap church schools. They forced so many ideas on me, and did not properly educate me on anything. I know this may sound homophobic, but there was a time that I was legitimately afraid of gay people in my life. I know better now, but they didn’t teach me how to be supportive and how nice these people actually are. They also pressured me into going to a private school, brainwashing me into thinking that was my only option when it wasn’t.

Now there are the sports schools that claim to be Christian. I myself have not gone to one, so I do not currently have an issue with these schools. They seem like great places honestly.

Now there are normal Christian schools as well. But they also may be pushy on ideas, but they also teach you how to be social and practice Christianity outside of the school walls. This is the school I am going to currently. It seems great at least for now.

Okay, so here’s a second paragraph on the small church schools, since I have so many problems with them. Mine was not that hard academically, so I didn’t study or learn the value of work. That lead to me struggling a lot in my classes, and almost failing during online learning. And like I said, these places are extremely pushy on ideas. Just like I said earlier, I was afraid of the lgbt community, thinking they were all evil people, like my school taught me. Thank God I have learned otherwise.

Sorry for this, but I just needed to get this off of me. My family thinks they made the right decision sending me to that God awful small church school, so they won’t listen to me. My friends won’t understand either. Maybe some random internet strangers will understand what I went through.

52272,"Failed to attempt suicide a few times and only a few things keep me alive(English is not my first language so sorry if I make mistakes) Hello, i am 19 years old. My life has always been quite a struggle. The past couple of years have been taking a toll on me. I am in a situation where I can't move out of my house or even move out (for personal reasons that involve my family). I had my first suicide attempt at the age of 13 because i was bullied severely and a bunch of older men online were humiliating me and they were stalking me. Some even asked for lewd photos, i did end up sending some just so they remove embarrassing posts they made of me that caused others to witch hunt me. I tried to hang myself. The next suicide attempt was when I was 15 when I ended up being in a horrible relationship with a man 4-5 years older than me. He was racist and sexist. I was also sexually assaulted around the same time but it was another person who did it. My entire life I've been very different from others. I just feel like i don't belong. Whenever people see me they either make fun of me, they are rude or they're scared of me. I grew up in a religious area and I was always the local emo kid. You can already tell how I'm usually treated here by my peers. Years pass by and at the age of 18 i attempt suicide again. I tried starving myself and I've attempted to get ran over and I attempted to jump off a highway but usually some pedestrians stop me. My parents have been fighting a lot, two relatives passed away and it made things worse for us. My sister (whom is disabled) hates my dad because he's become rude and demanding at times. I love my parents, but my dad's behavior needs to go. He's threatened to leave us. He's insulted my mom and he brushes off my mental health as just attention seeking. He does the same to my cousins whenever they've expressed their depressive state. I've tried telling them to not yell and fight over small things because it makes me uneasy and it gives me severe anxiety. I'm just told that I don't have anxiety. I've done ""drugs"" (cough medicines for example) at home just to shut the whole world around me. My dad isn't abusive at all, he's just unfortunately becoming like the rest of his family. Rude, judgemental, quick to start arguments and any little mistake will set him off. This morning my mom washed the wrong clothes for my dad and he got upset and told her to shut up because she's irritating. My sister's behavior has been getting worse too. Due to her condition she is very impressionable and ends up picking bad behavior from my dad. My dad is still a great person though and I understand he's been through a lot of shit. But it doesn't excuse him to be like this. Back then it was rare for him to argue but now it's so common. Like i said, his family is pretty toxic at times. The only things keeping me alive are my pets, my boyfriend and my love for videogames. I've been doing content online to distract me and to keep my family quiet since they know that they can't embarrass me and themselves during a live broadcast. While I enjoy doing that stuff, on the inside I'm just dead. I'm just going autopilot. The reason I do it is to have people to talk with while having fun. None of my family members can bother me while I'm doing it. I'm just afraid that one day I'll completely lose my passion for everything I love and I'll end up being gone from this world for good. If I could move out at this very moment I would pack my bags and go. But my family put me in a situation i didn't choose that is preventing me from traveling or moving out. I can't even get a job.

I know my dad thinks this is just an excuse for me to half ass being alive but I can’t help it.

I was trying to avoid my triggers like certain people or situations but now I’ve found myself sheltered off from the real world. But this intense urge to kill myself keeps coming back no matter how hard I try. For a while I switched to the bottle as a desperate attempt to smother these intense impulses, but it was counter productive because I would end up just being miserable while i was drunk, which made suicide seem justifiable.

I’m 17 now and when I was 7 my sister who was 9 at the time got molested in front of me by our baby sitters son and all I could do was feel ashamed in myself for not doing anything. All the while My mom would cry to me drunk out of her mind because my father left her. I had a little game I would play with her called “the bird who says don’t cry” where I would just lean into her and say “don’t cry!”. That’s all I can think of now. All this shit that happened when i was so young keeps coming back and boiling into anger aimed in no particular direction. Talking about it helps but only so much. 

The only thing keeping me going is my family. My mom is a bipolar drug addict, my brother is just as angry at nothing as I am (plus he’s slowly but surely developing an extremely intense alcohol problem to try and cope with everything), my other brother is a recovering drug addict, and my sister is my best friend who has kept me going in some dark ass times.

84421,"I don't really see the point of anything anymore.Hi, SW.

Recently I've lost my sense of enjoyment. I really can't enjoy anything anymore. I still do things I used to enjoy, purely out of habit. Recently, I've been staying in bed all day, and when I've gotten restless enough I've mainly just been killing time on reddit. I don't really see the point of going on with this boring and unfulfilling life anymore.

I've been diagnosed with depression since I was about 10, but recently my psychologist started to suspect bipolarity and borderline disorder. I'm also diagnosed with ADHD. 

Recently, I've also felt abandoned. A couple of months ago me and my ex broke up, and my life has been quite silent since then. However, lately it has gotten even worse. A couple of friends who used to be one of the greatest parts of my life and probably the only ones who made me feel close to happy are growing distant to me, but I can't put my finger on why. I keep blaming myself for this. I keep wondering what I did to make this happen.

So, how do I make my life worth living? Is it even worth a try?

Thanks in advance.

Recently, I've also felt abandoned. A couple of months ago me and my ex broke up, and my life has been quite silent since then. However, lately it has gotten even worse. A couple of friends who used to be one of the greatest parts of my life and probably the only ones who made me feel close to happy are growing distant to me, but I can't put my finger on why. I keep blaming myself for this. I keep wondering what I did to make this happen. So, how do I make my life worth living? Is it even worth a try?

88986,"Jokes gone wrongI have been depressed af recently and all I can think about is to end my life. I want to seek help, but a part of me is just like 'mehhh. Yo what the fuck. Don't tell anyone because no one wants to give a shit about you'. So I just simply give hints to people surrounding me by saying ""lmfao I want to die so that I can be famous"" so much in a sarcastic tone that everyone thinks that I'm joking. And there she is, the one that everyone has in their life, the one who misunderstand joke all the time. She would always tells me that 'yo dude u should really die lmao'. I know she just joking because she is the type who never actually wants to hurt people. And now even when I'm depressed af but I don't show it outside, she would just randomly 'are u tired or something? How about we go commit suicide together lol'.
Damn, it triggered me all the time but what can I do? After all I'm the one who started this joke. And now I begin to hate her for that, I mean like wtf is wrong with my dumb fuck brain? 
You know the positive and happy-all-the-fucking-time dude? That's exactly her. And now because of my fucking joke, she became a 'trendy shit' girl. She would always try to show her 'knowledge' about suicide like 'do u know that to buy a gun so that WE CAN COMMIT SUICIDE TOGETHER, we only need a little money' like yo wtf? You don't even want to die because you are a fucking coward, you love your life too much that you are even afraid of falling from some shitty P.E exercises. 
One time I confessed to her that although I was afraid of height, i felt really relaxed standing on high place(without looking down ofc). And boom, 'ikr. Because we can jump down and end our life forever!'. Uhh what? That's not what I meant at all. 
I'm addicted to self harm and recently I found a way to feel the pain (to release endorphin lol) even when I'm at school. I simply stab a needle in my arm and tape it. It hurts every time my arm bumps into something. So I just keep beating it when I feel the urge. And you know what? Just by sitting near her makes my arm numb till the end of the day because I just can't take the dumb shit joke she made.

I'm feeling sad right now. I decided to spend my last day on earth at one of my most  favorite places, the local university library. School was in and so there were a lot of people there. I was surprised at the number of good looking women there. Normally the populations I see are pretty homely.

I discovered a bunch of cool books there. One's Grammatical Man, which is a popular account of how information theory applies in describing people. I found Proofs and Types. I found a whole bunch of programming (as in math, optimization, not programming a computer). I read the introductory parts of a dynamic programming book and a geometric programming book. They were cool. I also read one on gravitational waves but it was kind of boring because it was one of those popular books that have too much history and not enough introducing me to the math.

So now I'm feeling sad because even though I'm not bright I am tenacious. I could have spent my life working at the metfab shop and spending my free time at the library.

But it is not to be. I can't cope anymore. I quit a job because they were going  to fire me for being late all the time. I can't get up in the mornings. I barely eat. Drugs and wanking  have lost their appeal. Life is just so tiresome.

Even though I feel sad, I feel that I am making the right decision. I can't get through life without  the support and forgiveness of all the people around me and that is in short supply.

The choice to want to end my life is completely my own. No one has influenced me or drove me to not want to continue living. My first suicide thought happened back in 2013 and at the time I brushed it off but after the next couple of years of poor grades, feeling I had no future, a failure and disappointment to myself and more importantly my family I made my first attempt to take my life in 2015. I waited for my parents to leave the house to which I went and grabbed my mothers Taurus Judge which was loaded and unsecured just in my mother's night stand. Held the firearm to my head and slowly put pressure on the trigger. The only thing that stopped me was the thought of what my parents would see when they did come home.  I was too afraid to seek personal help so I turned to online forums to see if I can help myself.  The repeating answer I found was ""Take it one day at a time"" 

Fast forward a couple of years I did scrape by and graduate high-school and enlisted in the military as an infantryman.  I am nervous about saying this but I turned down some bonus offers for different MOS because I fully expected to be deployed to a combat zone and get KIA. It wouldn't technically be suicide but me doing my job (I know I'm a piece of shit for even thinking that but its true and I wanted to get it off my chest) 

Well the combat deployment I had hoped for never came,  and beginning of 2020 was one of my darkest times. I grew tired of ""taking it one day at a time"" and sat down and made what was a fool proof plan to take my life. I bought my first AR-15 (was only 20 at the time so no pistol) and spent the next few weeks revising my plan. I knew exactly what,where,how, and when to do everything.  The last week before the date I set I tried my best to act as normal as possible. Bought my coworkers lunch, always volunteered at work, did a lot of favors for people so they suspected nothing. I made a mistake of getting absolutely shit faced on whiskey the night before and telling my online friends (whom I'm close with) my plan and saying my goodbyes. 

I know this is long as fuck so I'll shorten it now. They found where I'm at and reported me in, definitely saving my life. I immediately got apprehended and taken to a mental facility which sucked, but I was more concerned with my coworkers knowing of my attempt. Went to another facility shortly after  and now have a therapist I see weekly. It helped a little but the thoughts are definitely still there daily. 

I really do feel like a piece of shit because I have loving parents and few friends,  a steady income job, a roof over my head, and 3 meals a day. I know some people would kill to have what I have, I flat out shouldn't feel this way but I still do.

223525,"I want OUT!!!(New to Reddit so here goes) 

Today I woke up with extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Just like I did for years now.

My chest just keep s on hurting, my head is always humming with accusations of how dysfunctional I am.

I'm 26, currently a student and I'm failing my studies. I barely work at my job so I can work on my project, yet I'm still behind..

Even though I was supported financially by my Grandfather  I'm failing him..

I go to college almost everyday, even when there's no one in class, to work but no matter what I do it's not enough..

I come from a poor background (even now I support my mom and baby sister when I can as my mom is going through an ugly divorce, she barely takes care of herself and looks 52 at the age of 43 which freaks me out), so succeeding in my studies is important. 

My mom is no help herself, she's struggling so I can't turn to her..

My grandfather  doesn't understand the concept of depression . I once made the mistake of telling him about my suicidal thoughts..He honestly asked me is I'm insane..

I went to the psychiatrist and took anti depressants for about 3 years and suffered terribly from side effects. (Now I'm off after 1.5 years of trying to quit). 

I'm seeing a therapist  for 4 years now but when I sink in the suicide rut she seems helpless and unable to guide me out. She does a lot for me, checking in on me asking me to call her if I have thought but I can't burden her with myself on a daily basis beyond our meetings...

Even my boyfriend of 8 years is at a loss..he honestly doesn't know what to do with me anymore so he just goes through the motions. He, like the rest of the world have no time to pause for those who are frozen in place by pain and fear.

(He does try but he's not listening. Not really).

I can't turn to ER with my suicidal thought in my country in fear of being mistreated, admitted against my will and later stigmatized while looking for a job. (My therapist advised me against it for those reasons).

At college and work everyone avoids 'negative talk' and I always have to smile and mask myself. To the question ""How are you"" there is only one valid answer and it's always positive. Honestly, will people please stop asking if the don't wish to know? It's not as polite as our culture teaches.

I've been battling with this since age 8. I'm very tired. I really can't go on like this! this has to stop one way or another.

I need a guide. An actual guide. I don't want people to ""be there for me"" while passively holding my hand and feeling sorry for me.

I need someone to tell me how to get out of this black hole! Instructions! 

I cannot keep self harming just to get by day by day!

My favourite album is either [Ride the Lightning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeK1E1HaMdY&amp;list=OLAK5uy_k4yeBNbCJLDBeqj_QsTlpRoncOxmGLQDo) or [Master of Puppets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17E-zFb-0aE&amp;list=OLAK5uy_lHtcjdo7MU4A3Tt3MuErEdEOOqs4UgngE), but I can't really decide which I prefer.

- Before our history class, her and another girl wait outside because they don’t want to go in first. So I get to the class and they want me to go in first and she says “if you go in first I’ll love you”

Why are my family members surprised I don’t have a girlfriend??? They haven’t taught me any valuable social skills and put me down nearly every week! My parents have always hated each other and they both take it out on me one way or another! This has effected the way I view other people and I can’t hold on the friends, let alone romantic relationships. I BARELY have a decent relationship with relatives.

335137,"I dont know anymoreFirst of all something about me. I am 17 years old from germany. I am doing quite good in school and already achieved to get accepted at a university and a company I'd like to work at. Additionally, I am going to take my A-Levels next year. I do have a couple of friends and 1-2 I'd put my life in their hands. 
So far so good, but there are some downsides. About 7 years ago I had some bad friends which usually managed to ruin my whole day by making fun of me as I never really protected myself - obviously an easy victim. It continued several years and it did become better (they stopped someday and by now we dont have any contact anymore). But because of this I developed something like a anxiety. It is quite hard for me to talk to other people, I feel attacked even if it is not ment to insult me and I struggled to get new friends. I really had to rely on those few friends I had back then. 
Beeing a huge perfectionist I **hate** not beeing good/perfect at things -  having gross sensory motor skills is a real struggle sometimes. Last but not least, I hate getting ignored. It is not like I need attention but I start question everything when getting ignored. 

Now lets start with what I want to tell you. Back in 2015 my first relationship started. She was a cute girl but is shizophrenic. I had strong feelings but it ended after about 2 month as she told me she never really loved me and I was something like a substitute for her (mostly because of her illness). She liked me and my personality and said I am one of her best friends, but she does not love me. I was not able to handle my emotions at this time and we decided it would be better to cut off the contact after shet old me she had feelings for an old friend of mine. I was unhappy every single day (I still loved her), began smoking sometimes and with hindsight I most likely delevoped a ""small"" depression. 
About 7 month later my second relationship started which lasted for about 17 month. It ended last month in november. At the start we fell in love fast but I did not want to admit my feelings to her because I was still marked of my former relationship. Anyways, this relationship was awesome and I regret nothing. We had our controversies like everyone does. But the last couple month were hard. We both thought about ending the relatinship secretly sometimes and finally she ended it. I was okay with it. Of course I was unhappy, you cant just forget one and a half year. I really would have loved to return to a point we both were happy. I still do even tho my feelings did decrease. I should tell you she suffers from depression and borderline-personality-disorder. She was in a clinic at the time we ended it. But we actually decided we could stay friends a texted a bit.

But only 3 days later she told me she found someone new she knew from the clinic. I was dead for a moment. Later she posted pictures on facebook revealing they got together only 1 day after our break-up.
The new one is 8 years older then her (he is 26), did not achieve much in life and everyone who has seen him dislikes him. And my friends (also friends of her and even her best friend) dont believe this relationship will last long. I dont know whether it is selfish or something like this but I hate their relationship. I got replaced another time. Plus she gave me the fault for everyone thinking bad about her and her new boyfriend even tho I tried to tell everyone it is okay if she is happier with him. I still do like her and dont want anyone to think bad about her (believe me or not. It is hard, but i try to act like a nice person at least once).
Anyways. Since the day I knew she ""replaced"" me I hate myself. I regret every mistake I made in the relationship and so on. I try not to text her often because I dont want to annoy her, but when I do she mostly ignores me or answers about 4 hours later with only 1 word. It kills me innerly. I thought about ending contact, but I dont actually want to.

I do know there a many positive sides in my life. But I dont feel like they matter. There is not a single day I dont think about it and I started to think about how to end my life without hurting family and friends. At the moment a carbon monoxide poisoning seems interesting. Sport seems to be a good temporary stress relieve for me but it does not help long. I dont like hurting myself, I dont want every person to know about my situation. I use the knive game as an excuse for at least a little bit pain. 
I reached a mental situation in which nothing really matters to me. My parents (which I dont really like either) could die and I would not mind too much. My sense for pain decreased. I eat much less (which is not particullary bad as it supports loosing unneccessary weight) but force myself not to fall in an eating disorder. I sleep much worse. Overall: I dont want to end my life because it is sooo bad. I want to end it because I dont know why to continue. I could have reason. But I dont feel like they are important. At the moment I write letters to every important person in my life and think about what to give them when I do decide to end my life.

My father does not like my presence in this house, because they keep insisting that I changed. I used to smile a lot, but now I am mostly sulking in my room. I cry every night because I have a lot of shortcomings as a son. I'm really tired. They do not know the reason why I have suddenly changed, but I am sure it is because of my depression. My boyfriend took me to a psychiatrist a few months ago, it turns out I am depressed. I refuse to take my medicine because of its side effects. When I tried to tell my dad, he said mental illnesses are not real, so I kept it to myself. We had an argument a while ago, he told me I should leave his house. The problem is that most of my money is with him. He borrowed my money when he had nothing to feed us, He owes me around 2000 USD and he is in no condition to pay me that amount right now, which is why I am having second thoughts of pushing through. 

I love my parents, I would never replace them even if I had the chance to do so. However, I do wish that they would open their minds (and possible their hearts).

2. I'm gay. It's not a choice, but they do not understand that. If it was a choice, I'd rather be straight. Things would be so much easier as a straight man. 

3. I'm depressed, but my family doesn't know. I tried to tell them, but they do not believe in mental illnesses.

132887,"After thinking about it for a while, my perspective on death has become more ""positive"". Have any of you experienced the same thing?Further explanation:

A few months ago, when the severity of my depressive episodes seemed to increase, I started making very  clear plans on how I'd go about dying. One obstacle I always faced (and an obstacle I know I will face to some degree in the moments before death) when making these plans is the primal urge to shy away from anything lethal. I know that no matter how much I convince myself I want to die, my body will always try, to some degree, pull back from the act. The thought of such hesitancy caused me a lot of stress, but over time my thought of death itself changed. 

Think about the time before your were born. Nothing. A total lack of consciousness. Almost like sleeping for a very, very long time. Now, death could be viewed simply as a lack of consciousness also (much like sleeping). As a side note, I think one of the reasons humans fear the thought of death so much is because death is impossible for our conscious minds to conceptualize (by deff'n death involves an absence of consciousness). In a way, death is just another really long sleep. And we have already spent billions of years in that long sleep before we are born. And no matter what we do, or make, or create, or love, we will all sleep again. ""So why not now?"" I sometimes think. ""Sure, I could live for 60 more years, but life already seems dull and meaningless. I find it hard to be close to people emotionally, I'm not interested in very much, I don't have plans to raise a family, I don't have the desire to chase girls...etc.. In the long run, 60 years means nothing. I'm slowly moving closer to death every day. And if I look at things this way, it doesn't seem so bad."" 

I guess the only thing holding me back is my parents and a good friend of mine. I just think I'd like to say the appropriate ""goodbyes,"" if you understand.

I was that kid that was supposed to be a brilliant adult, I was even voted most likely to be president in middle school, so that shit was legit. But bam!, everything changed when the fire nation attacked, and by fire nation, I mean chronic depression and anxiety, the lucky combo of misery bitch!  I  was 18 when I was diagnosed, and I went through college after that, trying really hard not to fail my classes (I failed 4 lol), but also, not to kill myself (I tried it once lolx2). Of course during college,  I did nothing college like, socially speaking. 

Fast forward to the present, I'm 23, and I have not a single friend (I mean this, is not an exaggeration, like, my only ""friends"" are my siblings). I quit social media like 4 months ago, and I hoped people would noticed it, but nope, no one. I really could've kill myself without no one, but my family, giving two fucks. 

I graduated exactly a year ago, and let me tell you, if you think that college is hard or whatever, and when you get out,  things will be better, guess what? Think again, I was naive when I thought I would be living my best life now. Life is horrible at any stage. This is a fucked up video game, and I'm an idiot who doesn't even get the plot. 

Now I have no money (my parents are paying my rent), no job (I'm looking for jobs like crazy and no one calls back, no one answers my emails, why are recruiters so mean??? I know you opened the fucking email application Barbara, my anxiety made me put a tracker on it!) I think I'm going crazy, everyone around me has a job, and I'm just here crying because I chose a useless major, and I found out I didn't like it on my senior year.

And when I think this couldn't get any worse, I realize I've been 23 years in this world without ever being in love. I have never kissed anyone, I have no boyfriend or prospects (I'm a straight girl btw), and I'm the horniest virgen I know.  People at my age are doing interesting things, living life, having fun. The most interesting thing I've ever done was survived my suicide attempt, that's it.

So, no money, no love, no friends, no happiness, and of course, I gained like 20 pounds cuz' fuck it, I'm a failure. And I wrote a fucking Bible that no one is gonna read...

What i realized in the past weeks is that i've never fitted in.  Not the ""i'm different than anyone else"" kind of not fitting in. Maybe that too. But i´ve always felt like a wanderer seeking a place to stay. But never found one. Maybe some people are supposed to be alone. But lonelieness slowly kills you. Who knows...

Anyway, my depression is getting worse and worse. I'm falling into a black hole and i can't seem to get out. It is so much pain i don't want to feel it anymore. Its a parasite which is going to kill me. Man, it already did. I'm dead inside. I'm numb. I don't care about people. I lost my empathy.  If i look in the mirror all i see is a stranger. Thats not me. I'm tired of living its so exhausting.

I hate myself so much that it hurts. I just don't want to be myself anymore. I'm a pathetic piece of shit.  

I was always the shoulder to cry on. I always tried to help. But that breaked me. Always giving never receiving. But thats probably just fucking selfish to think. I'm not even in my twenties and i've already failed my life. School stresses me out. Everyone seems to get along with it, i dont.I have panicattacs because of it. (I don't have autism or something like that).    

When i was younger i always wanted to be something bigger. I had dreams. Now i lost all my interests and everything.  I stare at my wall 8 hours a day waiting for death.

My life isn't even that bad. I have water, a house, food you know. People always told me to be more grateful, as if thats the solution to everything.Maybe it is.

No one gives a fuck about me. It doesnt matter wether i'm alive or not.  All i do is wasting food. If i could give my life who actually wants to live. I wouldnt even hesitate, but thats not how it works.

Nature is beautiful. Animals are too. But humanity is fucking not. They are all fucked up and selfish (like me). 

People are always saying shit like : i'd rather listen to your problems than attending your funeral"". Where were you when i wanted to talk??  Or : suicide tís not the answer. Then what is?

My family is toxic. They all are mentally sick. Its really hard growing up like that.  Maybe its one of the reasons maybe not. /for depression)

I have a hard time opening up. I feel judged when i do. And when i do i always hear shit like its gets better.

I hate my mind. The way i think. Everything.

I had friends, but i lost all of them. Every single one. Because i was too depressed to actually keep friends. I'm an asshole and a shit friend. I've lost half of my life memories because i was depressed. There are people who have it worse and i'm sitting here and thinking about killing myself. That makes me a shit person.

I would also like to add that hoping for revenge by killing yourself is also dumb. These people you mention, they won't remember you a year from now, so stop acting like they are out to get you. Stop blamimg them for your problems. Stop acting like a child. All the people you mentioned are probably sleeping like babies right now, and here you are posting some bullshit rant, and getting so worked up about stuff that is in the past and doesn't matter anymore."" This subreddit was the ONLY place I had left to turn to.",suicide,0.58452964,0.44546342,0.44209436,0.45826042,0.69995666

When I love I love a lot, with all my heart and all my energy and I feel that people don’t understand that and call me “too much” I don’t want to be too much, but unfortunately, I am, I don’t like to talk and make plans with people other than my boyfriend (I guess you can call me unsocial), so when I’m not with him, I feel lonely and lost, and when he goes away from me because he had too much I feel that he doesn’t need me, he wants me gone.

My mom is broken because of me, because she sold everything that she can to give me the opportunity to study in a different country, and here I’m just wasting my life without a purpose in life, no living just existing, and for my dad I feel bad for not being the perfect child, not being more like him, but instead being what he doesn’t believe that is real. “Life will get better” NO! life was supposed to get better a long long ago, but it didn’t.

I always always help through fun birthday parties for people, ever since I've moved ive helped throw and organize 3, one was even a surprise party. I put lots of money and effort into these parties. Its not like I did this to expect anything back, its not that, its just sad when people just dont care. Not one of my close friends posted on my fb, which its just like such an easy thing. Everyone is on fb, everyone sees the birthday notification, but they chose to not even say a word. I know this sounds so stupid and whiney but its just like solidifies the idea that i dont matter. I never ever did to my friends. And its not them its me. I dont deserve to be cared about, im the annoying person that hangs around them and they deal with it and i appreciate that they do but why should I even bother them anymore, theyd be so better off without me. My mother could literally care less that I exist, she is coming home for Christmas and posted a status about how she was so excited to see her mother, her sister in law and her niece. Not a word about me or my sister. She knew wed see it obviously if we have her on fb. Not even the person who gave birth to me can remember i exist. All I am good for is being used occasionally. I am not worth the air I breath. I just take up space and time that other people could be using. I am ugly and fat, and everyone knows it. I can tell people are disgusted by me, and im so sorry that they even have to look at me. I wish I would just disappear, people would only notice because I have duties like getting the bills ready to pay.
My other friend was having a rough time and everyone rushed to her side to help her, to be there for her. But no one cares about me, maybe because i have felt bad on and off for so long, maybe because im disgusting and dont matter, maybe everyone is secretly hoping ill kill myself so they can stop being annoyed by me. the only thing that keeps me here is my pet, and i mean how sad is that. That the only thing that needs me is my pet because he has to because i have to take care of him. I just dont want to try anymore im so sick of trying and im so sick of not mattering. I know it sounds all so stupid but everyone of my friends all care and love each other so much but when it comes to me im just nothing I dont want to leave bed or my room i just want to eat junk food until i cant move and just rot away. Im so digusting and unattractive, no one will ever love me, ill be alone forever, no one will ever care, so why dont i just fucking end it get it over with what the point on sticking around, there is none. I want to end my life so bad, i feel like looking up suicide methods is so so comforting because its like i know there is a way to escape. I know i am stupid and people hate me because i have no reason to feel this way but it only makes me want to end it more. There is no help I can get, ive done it all. Why bother i just dont want to take up space and peoples time anymore i hate being a burden I just dont want this anymore. i want my friends to be happy and have a good life and they dont deserve someone who is disgusting and a nuisance in their life.

184730,"i just want to be loved and appreciated i’ve been through too much of this same shit. my relationship is crumbling and i can’t do much about it. i can’t force the other side of this to care. 

last night i sobbed on the phone for i’m not sure how long. but it felt like a long time. and my boyfriend couldn’t do anything, he didn’t feel anything. and i don’t think he feels anything right now. idk how much longer i can do this, where i don’t feel loved or appreciated.

he hasn’t put in much effort lately. it honestly feels like i’m carrying this relationship on my back and it’s exhausting because school is already taking so much out of me, i can’t be the perfect girlfriend. i tried. even me trying isn’t appreciated. nothing i do is appreciated anymore. he expected me to show him my body on call when i can’t even look at myself in the mirror anymore. i suppressed emotions because it felt like if i didn’t he would blow up at me and tell me he doesn’t love me again. and i can’t go through another time of my bf telling me he doesn’t love me anymore. the emotional toll of that experience has proven true because i wonder every single waking moment if he still loves me. and i really shouldn’t have to do that. his words are starting to hold much less weight over time because i don’t know if he means it. and now my words aren’t holding weight anymore because I’d tell him that i’m okay when i really wasn’t. i wanted to ease tension by putting aside my own feelings and just bottling them up. i never wanted to talk about them. 

he’s angry with me. and i’m angry at him for not showing any effort or sweetness. he’s angry at me for me getting angry. this is so exhausting. it feels like he’s taking me for granted or purposely pushing me away. it feels like he doesn’t appreciate me being around anymore. i don’t know how much more of this i can take. i just wanna stop existing. everything is so painful. 

earlier he told me “i hope you weren’t lying about your exes”. my exes have been toxic. one of them would only be happy if i sent nudes. another would compare me to girls all the time and gaslight me whenever i got upset about it. another one wouldn’t show any emotion other than annoyance or disgust with me. they’ve all caused me to hate myself more and more. one after the other, my self hatred grows. partly because i let myself take this treatment and partly because i kept being told i wasn’t good enough. over and over again. and i have the same feeling of me not being good enough.

i don’t feel beautiful. i don’t feel valued. i don’t feel appreciated. i don’t feel loved. i don’t feel happy. 

i don’t have enough friends to distract myself. i’ve dedicated myself to the same person for the past 5 months and now i don’t know if it was worth anything. mostly because i don’t know if he’s willing to put in effort anymore. mostly because i think he knows he can find another girl very easily and discard me like the others. i’ve sacrificed so much for one person, and my mom was right about how we get hurt when we put too much effort into one person. my mom was right when she said women are stupid when they’re in love.

i’m getting back to that dark place in my life where i had no appetite. i’d weigh myself morning and day and make sure i only lose weight. i’m getting back to the point where i cry every night wondering if i’m worth anything to anyone and wondering if i disappeared if anything would change. i know at this point people would only benefit from my lack of existence. everyone in my life could stand a lot less me being around. i don’t know what to do about this because if i talk to my boyfriend about this then he’d tell me i’m dumping my feelings onto him. i can’t talk to my therapist half the time because our sessions are only 50 minutes and outside those sessions he takes a long time to respond. my parents aren’t emotionally capable enough to empathize with me and help me get through this. i don’t want to talk to this about my friends because it’s not their problem. i have no one right now.

i’ve sought help; had countless doctors appointments and have been prescribed a plethora of medication that doesn’t seem to work. i’ve been to regular therapy sessions, counseling, tried self care and meditation... basically i’ve turned to anything and everything in attempts to lessen these feelings and to no avail. 
 
every day truly feels like a battle to get out of bed and keep going. i don’t find joy in any of the things i once used to, lack appetite and energy, i’m deeply saddened every day for no other reason than that’s just what depression does to me. every day the thought of suicide crosses my mind; how much easier it would be if the world were just to stop, to not have to deal with the pain anymore. 

i’ve felt this way for so long that it just feels pointless to continue. there’s no point in waiting for a “new day” when every new day turns out just the same as it always has. i don’t want to wake up tomorrow, i don’t want to keep breathing, and i don’t want to wait and find out if “it gets better”

99090,"I have suicidal thoughts and I don't know what to do with them.TRIGGER WARNING: suicidal thoughts and eating disorders

Sorry for the long post, tldr in the end. 

Someone suggested I post this on this subreddit so here it is. 

Context: I'm 26, unemployed though have a great degree, have been abused my whole life by family and bullies and teachers alike, have a wild array of mental illnesses caused by that.

I ran away from home and moved in with my boyfriend (to his dad's house) who is an amazing person generally. The thing is, he broke up with his previous gf to be with me. We have a past going way back, and we sort of just fell in love again when we talked again after several years. He didn't have time to grieve the loss of that relationship, which he's doing now. He told me he misses her and he doesn't usually think about her, but when he starts thinking he can't stop.

He also learned his lifelong best friend had been hitting on this ex, breaking one of the biggest bro codes. Well, he learned that a few hours after I saw on his phone that he had texted his ex saying he missed her. I told him that's unacceptable and it won't happen again or I'm gone. 

I know a lot of people will say just break up with him now but I'm not going to. He deserves a chance to grieve a relationship that he ended on bad terms, and I'm accepting this one fuck up as nothing more than a fuck up. He doesn't have any other bad points yet that would have me end my relationship and for me this is just human nature. 

The thing is, since this happened, I have a whole lot of bad thoughts. My eating disorder I feel is relapsing, and I've been in recovery for about a year now and all that might go to waste. I can't afford to see my therapist at the moment since neither me nor my boyfriend have any proper income, only some allowance from parents.

I constantly have thoughts like ""I've never been happy, all the people I should be able to trust wholeheartedly has hurt me one way or another, what's the point in staying alive?"" or ""If I were dead I wouldn't need to deal with all this shit."" I haven't been this suicidal in maybe a year as well. I had been recovering on a lot of levels.

I was used to being suicidal all the time before but I've been okay for so long now that I have no idea how to handle this. I keep taking xanax (prescribed to me alongside an antidepressant) but I'm running out and I don't want to keep taking it and develop an addiction. I don't know what to do with myself once the thoughts come out.

How to deal with being suicidal? Or intrusive thoughts? Any advice is appreciated.

You know?, The lockdown took heavy toll on me, as I got skinny day by day and got more shy and uncomfortable with new people around.
The silent kid was or still be afraid to talk to people  in school. I don't know bout other silent kids but for me I was afraid of getting judged, I was already judged in my neighborhood.
I was a heavy gamer, playing game 4,5 hrs a day just to clear the loneliness and stress inside of me.
I thought eSports could be a thing, that I can do in future.
But a big NO for me, as I grinded game, i got confused with the reality and fantasy. I started having severe headache's and lot of things. 
In study's I wasn't a dumb student but more less than that( I was dumber more than Dora the explorer).

Financial condition isn't that great either( Almighty have some mercy!!!). We were barely able to pay my school fees( maybe that is the reason, why i was afraid?).

As lockdown carried on and it's been year now(damn!!!!, I want old days back) few weeks back I left gaming (cheer up Bois, almighty had some sympathy) and thought what should I do????(the question whole universe wants know) and I started studying( for 5,6 hrs), ok as a guy who's dumber than dore the explorer, it is not a easy task.

206105,"Having a hard time finding meaning for going on any longer.Hello there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a hard time finding a reason to go on with my life. 

I am massive procrastinator. I'm turning 26 soon and I haven't accomplished much.

So basically I had a rough childhood. I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome and ADHD at a young age which made making friends and focusing extremely hard. I was sexually abused at 10 years old and people started bullying me for that.

I got very lonely and started escaping into porn and video games at the age around 10-11 years old. I got hooked on both for 14 years. In high school I got introduced to marijuana. Got pretty addicted to that as well and finally got off it and all my other addictons this May. Been sober from all the old bad habits almost.

After high school I went to College. The first degree was pretty interesting but not very welll paying but I made a very good set of friends. For the first time in my life I belonged into a group. However after the first year I changed the degree into a ""better one"" which would allow me to easier get jobs and higher pay. I moved city and from the very beginning I got depressed and very avoidant. This was in 2015.

Now in 2020 I still haven't cleared the first years studies. I got so stuck into my avoidant behavior that I did not do almost anything else during those 5 years than video games, porn, alcohol, tobacco, crappy food and weed. I just distracted myself from the passage of time.

May 2020 I realized I am 25 years old, no degree yet, 25 000€ debt, wasted 12+ hours a day for the last 5 years, no job record, still a virgin, no savings, no investments, crappy ""friends"" that don't pull me forward in life.

I feel so horrible for wasting that much time! I could have trained my creative passions like playing guitar or drawn but I did not put effort into anything.

Actually that is probably the most disturbing thing I'm facing... I never put effort into anything and wasted and am still wasting the most precious resource of all: TIME.

I have got so obsessed with time that it put me on sick leave. The doctor ordered me to not hink about time for a few weeks. Which is horrible because all great things, learning, earning, experiences, love all of them require the investment of time.

&amp;#x200B;

I am paying a massive price for my years of procrastination. It is true that ou can't have it all in life but I've realized that going to be even more tough for me now due to not putting in any major effort to escape the comfort zone for 5 FUCKING YEARS!!! 

And one thing hat is not helping at all is that I've watched way too amny youtube videos about productivity and success. All of them repeat the same thing: TIME is most precious, AND START NOW.

I have this massive amount of things to do and wishes to accomplish but I'm realizing day by day how hard my life will become if I don't start working like hell. Not helping at all the countless mistakes that I HAVE not made. It is like being 15 on the inside and 26 on the outside.

I never really took the time to figure out what I wanted to accomplish in my life. I chose the wrong degrees leaving my hobbies and passions to suffer. I've left a massive minefield of crap behind me which will not go away.

Now I'm starting to lose relatives and the lockdown is affecting my family. I feel disgusting for not using the tools and energy I have to further myself in the right way. 

Everytime I'm about to start something I freeze thinking about how much time it will cost me if I commit to it and in the end I end up wasting time not doing anything at all. I want to be productive so bad that I've ended becoming even more unproductive.

My dreams of becoming financially free or having a family before 35 are at risk every second.

I need to grow up into an adult in some way, taking responsibility, stop wasting time, being productive but I have too many paths to choose from. Two different degrees that I'm falling behind on and 3 creative passions that are underdeveloped due to my procrastination.

I already regret so much for wasting so much time and it gets worse every day. I wake up with a panic attack and take meds for it and start doing something. Usually it is only minor things like food, cleaning up, checkiing clothes and then I realize in the evening that I haaven't taken any big step to improve my life, just staying alive.

I do not know what to study, the doctor says I'm in no condition to start working and I've ended up with a lot of ""free-time"". I know I should not use this golden opportunity on vane things like video games or movies. 

I am getting help from a psychologist and a life coach but still feeling time is going to get the best of me.

Most of my days go in self defeating thoughts like my life already ruined, this is  waste of time, why did you do that? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure if I can take this for very long anymore. I want to believe and know that I can have a normal life and not fall into mediocrity or poverty. I have all the tools and all the knowledge, how can I break the comfort zone before I decide to kill myself?",suicide,"Having a hard time finding meaning for going on any longer.Hello there. &amp#x200B I have a hard time finding a reason to go on with my life.

- I am coming from a Vietnamese family (immigrant background)
- childhood was kinda rough, I am culturally adapted but people obv. still point out that I am not a true part of this society
- my father is addicted to gambling and used to steal my saved up money to feed his addiction ($1000 to be precise, I was ten)
-somehow I inherited that trait, I can't drink or play video games in moderation, so I have to completely abstain from it
- I also inherited scarring alopecia (folliculitis decalvans) from him
- But the worst of all is that I have body odor, like ridiculously thick body odor and shit breath. I smell like shit or mold and bathing or changing up my diet hasn't worked. I consulted doctors all over the country and nothing helped. I am a very clean person usually.
- Due to this condition I can't hold any jobs (gotta life by the financial aid of my parents), not even talk about having a girlfriend
- oh I also have a small dick but that is the tiniest (yikes) problem of mine
- *My life has no future due to this*. I can't ahve any financial foundation I luck out and win the lottery or rob the bank with my body odor or something lmao.
- I can't have kids because of my conditions. At least I am definitely not intending to forward those genes.

Now the contras:

- I have really good friends (like more than you would think), they are loyal, smart and winners in life. I don't even know why they are friends with me, guess I have a personality.
- Due to wanting to escape from real life, I joined a music forum back in 2010 and also happened to make friends there through IRL meetups. 20 of us meet several times each year. Hell, I even travel with some of those guys one by one and some of them are very important friends of mine now.
- I am not dumb. Got my A-levels.
- My sister looks up to me. We are really good friends and we love sharing time together. I can't do this to her.
- My mother would go through fire for me
- Which is why I just can't off myself. I would sadden so many people and some of them lost loved ones already and I don't want them to experience that pain again.


It's a tough situation for me. And I know this sounds like a pity party, but my life just has no fucking future besides being a financial burden. It is like God created me with -50 on every stat on my character. Some people like me, strangers don't because I stink. I can't have jobs but have supportive people around me. I just can't keep living like this.

But then my then best friend came into the picture and started getting intimate with her, I didn't really care because I have the mindset of ""if we have something going on and you choose someone else then that's your choice I'm not going to get between it."" So we were having a kind of on and off unofficial relationship. It was going okay until like 7-8 months ago when she just kinda disappeared with him. We've talked over social media, but it just isn't the same thing. And I can't see her because she's in a toxic relationship with her so called ""boyfriend"" (my ex best friend).

206803,"Thoughts on my situation?Now, I'm pretty sure typing this out is stupid of me, but I might as well give it a try. See, I don't think I'm depressed, although, I definitely am suicidal, as I had multiple shots at suicide attempts in the past, but as you can see it didn't work out for me just yet, and I've given up lately until my will to do it builds up over the course of multiple months, and I attempt it yet again due to a burst of negative emotion.

Told my family, they always forget, think I'm making shit up to get their attention, do nothing next. Was in therapy, it didn't help. I don't know why, but I just can't seem to derive satisfaction from the thought of possessing a ""bright future,"" how people like to call it. A good job, a family, wealth, or something similar. It's just, I don't even want a partner, I'm not interested in sexual experience. The only satisfactory thing in my life, or you could say, ""outside"" of it, seems to be the belief an afterlife exists, a delusional belief of being happier, more entertained, *satisfied* if I'd die. It's odd, I acknowledge it as being wrong, but alas, I just crave for it. What should I do, even? Might as well ask, since it doesn't hurt me, and it might even help me if something's convincing, but it probably won't change the fact I'm going to attempt suicide in one way or another in the near future, yet again, this time in a more effective manner than before, until it brings upon my end.

Thank you for responding, if you will.

297439,"Yo does anyone wanna chattttt? DM me :))) Wild potato species, originating in modern-day Peru, can be found throughout the Americas, from the United States to southern Chile.[3] The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by indigenous peoples of the Americas independently in multiple locations,[4] but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes. In the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia, from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex, potatoes were domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago.[5][6][7] In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.

Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish. Today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. As of 2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food crop after maize (corn), wheat, and rice.[8]

Following millennia of selective breeding, there are now over 5,000 different types of potatoes.[6] Over 99% of presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile.[9][10]

The importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region and is still changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe, especially Northern and Eastern Europe, where per capita production is still the highest in the world, while the most rapid expansion in production over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia, with China and India leading the world in overall production as of 2018.

Like the tomato, the potato is a nightshade in the genus Solanum, and the vegetative and fruiting parts of the potato contain the toxin solanine which is dangerous for human consumption. Normal potato tubers that have been grown and stored properly produce glycoalkaloids in amounts small enough to be negligible to human health, but if green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed to light, the tuber can accumulate a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health.[11][12]",non-suicide,"Yo does anyone wanna chattttt?

271835,"I can feel the depression coming on and might need some help to get through itHello all,

I'm not usually a depressed person (usually very happy), however, I find that when school starts and I'm under stress, even if it just little things, I become really depressed to the point where I am cutting myself and scouting places to jump if things get too bad. For a year, I have had a lighter course-load (15 credits) than my first semester which was when I first became deeply troubled and started to feel trapped, scared, and angry. This upcoming semester, I'm taking more classes than ever, and many of them are rigorous courses then I've ever had before. As the beginning nears, I have begun to have bouts of extreme stress overcome me and am fearful that I may become extremely depressed again. If there is anybody who would be willing to give me some help to avoid some of this depression I would greatly appreciate it.

Other details: 20/m sophomore 4.0 GPA on scholarship which adds to stress. Forever alone. No friends at all. 

Thanks for any help.

Then right after the cowboys quarter back snapped his ankle the conversation some how became politics. I have no idea what happened there was no hinting towards that the conversation before that was related at all and then just Biden Vs. Trump. 

This usually doesn’t happen that often but with the election close it has been happening more frequently.

For example, when the Mulan remake came out I was telling someone I didn’t like it because all the good stuff from the original was removed (like Mushu, the cricket, and the singing). Then I was called sexist because “I thought Mulan needed help.” After they said this I was really annoyed. Those characters were there for comic relief and the songs were just because it was a Disney movie. But, in the new movie there is none of that and is supposed to be more “historically accurate” but they have Mulan take down an entire army basically and add witches.

That’s really it but I just read it again and it turned from a rant about older generations turning everything to politics to a Mulan rant. So sorry about that.

But still why can’t people just like things to like things not everything has to do with your beliefs.

82121,"I want to talk about self harm for a minute. **Trigger warning** well i am talking about self harm, not really going in any graphic details but still, i may dip my toes into depression scuicide ect.. so i am not going to suggarcoat things if this can be a trigger for you i recomend finding another post. Stay safe kiddos

Also second warning. I am just one teenager online. ***I am not a proffesional*** this is mainly from my own personal knowledge on the matter 

Why am i making this post ? I think allot of people don’t know the extent of what self harm is and or why people do it. So i wanted to talk about that. Again. Not a medical proffesional. I am talking from my personal experience and from what i read online.

**1) what is self harm ?** 

This may seem like a dumb question but honestly it’s one of the reason why i wanted to make this post in the first place. Honestly self harm has been ascosciated with cutting way too much nowadays. Self harm at it’s core is simply well.. ""self harm"". And that goes way beyond just cutting, yes cutting hurts like hell and is one of your most damaging and dangerous options that’s why it’s talked about allot but hiting yourself, scratching yourself, eating harmfull things, hiting things with no protection to cause harm... basicaly anything that you do to harm yourself. Honestly if i cought my concerning behaviors and talked about them before it became ""too much"" to talk about i could have saved myself allot of pain, this is why it’s important to talk about.

I know this may sound dumb and obvious. But it may not be obvious to everyone.

**2) why self harm ?** 

Again may sound like a stupid question but it’s something not everyone understand or realise.

*Self harm is not nescescarly used with scuicidal intent.* In allot of cases it’s more of an unhealthy coping mechanism. If one of your loved ones self harmed that does not imidiately mean that they are scuicidal. Like i said. An unhealthy coping mechanism. it’s used as an escape, so what they try to escape from can come with things like depression and scuicidal toughts. But it doesn’t mean that they are.

**3) what to do**

This one is one to take with a grain of salt. Because i am not a medical proffesional. And everyone is different. But in the end it’s important to make use of your own judgement and knowledge of the person 

Self harm is a touchy subject for the one who inflict it upon themselves in allot of cases. So it’s important to be sensitive. Show care but don’t push for answers. Be gentle. If you cought someone self harming (especialy if it’s some form of self harm with severe physical effects ie bleeding) they are likely in a fragile state and it’s important to remeber that.

Self harm doesn’t come out of nowhere so there is an issue and or a reason behind it. There is a reason why someone feels an itch or a need to hurt themselves human brains aren’t made to hurt their host body without a good reason. So talking to a proffesional is important. Talking to thoses close to them is important. 

Remeber that self harming usualy starts in small mudaine ways, it usualy escelates from ""more gentle"" form of self harm like scratching ect... So if you do that to yourself it’s *very important* to talk about it. Because even if it isn’t really harmfull... there is a reason why you feel the need to do that. And the reason behind it can’t really ever be good.. it may be a mild problem but even then it’s good to take care of it before it becomes worse.

It’s something serious and it’s very important to talk about it. Remeber that there is always help. 

So thanks for reading my post. I know some things may sound obvious. But for the few that it may help, it’s there.

So we do the  thing which is cool to do in a murderer case: go hang ourselves behind the mall. Before doing it we talked and talked untill night fall and then we hear someone says: hei fat kid turn around (this was ment to Obama as he's a fat fuck) we all look to this direction and a police is standing there with a knife in both his hand and says: empty your pockets kids Howard starts to try and calm the guy off but Gilbert hed other plans. The madman jumped on him kicked the knife off his hand and gave him a taison uppercut in which point he slapped Howard and kicked him.now no one slaps my ass but me so i came to him. Gilbert kicks him and Obama is helping Howard out.

At the end we tied him up using the ropes we brought and called the police. They shot each of us 15 times in the chest.
